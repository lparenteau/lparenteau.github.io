      <description>The Problem
When you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.
Actions Taken
My first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t.</description>

      <description>You’ve hired seven people, spread across 5 different time zones. You’re optimistic about your team; you’ve chosen them well and are looking forward to what you’ll build together. But now the easy part is done (hiring), you have to build that distributed team as a cohesive unit.
This is a challenge that all teams have, it isn’t specific to distributed team. But it is a challenge that all distributed team knows they need to tackle.</description>

      <description>There’s a world of difference between a 100% remote business and a business where remote work is the exception. If you work remotely and are in that 2nd group, here are 7 tips to help you succeed in that situation.
Look for a 100% remote environment, or at least a remote friendly place

      <description>For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.
As the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected.</description>

      <description>No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!

 They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.</description>
