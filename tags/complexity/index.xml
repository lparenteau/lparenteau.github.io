      <description>In the world of software engineering, complexity often takes center stage. We celebrate intricate algorithms, sprawling architectures, and convoluted code as signs of expertise. But what if I told you that complexity isn&amp;rsquo;t always the answer? In fact, more often than not, simpler solutions are not only easier to understand and maintain but also more effective in solving real-world problems.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why complexity is alluring. Complex code and systems can make us feel like we&amp;rsquo;re tackling profound problems, and they can impress colleagues and peers.</description>

      <description>The Problem
When you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.
Actions Taken
My first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t.</description>
