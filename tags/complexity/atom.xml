      <title>Escaping the Valley of Death: Gradient Descent Strategies for Startup Survival</title>

      <description>In machine learning (core to neural network, AI, and LLM), gradient descent is a robust optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It works by iteratively stepping toward the steepest descent, gradually honing in on the optimal solution.
In the startup world, founders embark on a journey to find product/market fit (PMF)—that magical inflection point where their product perfectly satisfies a strong market demand. This process often involves continuous iteration, pivoting when necessary, and refining their offering based on market feedback.</description>

      <description>Time flies, competition moves, and money runs out. This environment is the harsh reality that every startup confronts. With countless tasks to accomplish and limited resources, startups are perpetually in a race against time. The question is not whether you can do everything—you can&amp;rsquo;t—but how do you decide what to do first?
The art of prioritization is crucial for startup success, yet it must be more widely recognized and done appropriately.</description>

      <description>In startups, rapid growth is the holy grail. Founders dream of the day their company takes off, experiencing exponential user growth, revenue, and market share. However, this dream scenario comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for engineering teams. Recently, I had an enlightening conversation with the head of engineering at a young startup experiencing this very situation. Their story is a valuable lesson for engineering leaders facing similar challenges in fast-growing environments.</description>

      <title>Exponential Growth: Myth, Reality, and Strategic Considerations</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the Indian story of the man who asked for his reward to be 1 grain of wheat placed on the 1st square of a chessboard and doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square. While there are only 64 squares, you&amp;rsquo;d need 2,000 times the world&amp;rsquo;s wheat production to provide that reward. This famous story shows our lack of intuition about exponential growth and its power.</description>

      <title>Decoding Success and Failure: A Rational Approach</title>

      <description>In the ever-evolving world of software engineering, we are often presented with the challenge of assessing successes and failures. When evaluating our own performance, we frequently attribute our successes to our skills and our failures to bad luck. However, when it comes to evaluating the results of our competitors, the tendency is quite the opposite: we tend to ascribe their failures to a lack of skill and their successes to sheer luck.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Grey: A Probabilistic Approach to Engineering Decision-Making</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of successes and failures in the world of technology. Throughout the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across various approaches to decision-making and problem-solving, each with its own set of principles and methodologies. However, one idea that recently struck a chord with me is the concept of &amp;ldquo;thinking in bets&amp;rdquo; as outlined by Annie Duke in her book of the same name.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore how this concept can revolutionize the way we make decisions in the field of software engineering and challenge the conventional wisdom that often prevails.</description>

      <title>The Power of Simplicity: Why Complex Solutions Aren&#39;t Always Better</title>

      <description>In the world of software engineering, complexity often takes center stage. We celebrate intricate algorithms, sprawling architectures, and convoluted code as signs of expertise. But what if I told you that complexity isn&amp;rsquo;t always the answer? In fact, more often than not, simpler solutions are not only easier to understand and maintain but also more effective in solving real-world problems.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why complexity is alluring. Complex code and systems can make us feel like we&amp;rsquo;re tackling profound problems, and they can impress colleagues and peers.</description>

      <title>Picking the Right Tool for a Remote Engineering Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/picking-the-right-tool-for-a-remote-engineering-team/</link>

      <description>The Problem
When you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.
Actions Taken
My first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t.</description>
