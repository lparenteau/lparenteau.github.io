      <description>I started a newsletter almost one year ago, and I have really enjoyed doing that. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to discuss and share insights on product engineering, leadership, and personnel growth. I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing articles, events, and any other interesting tidbits I find.
Past editions aren&amp;rsquo;t available online, and while some parts may not be relevant (such as events), it would be interesting to summarize a few of them into a single blog post.</description>

      <description>You’ve hired seven people, spread across 5 different time zones. You’re optimistic about your team; you’ve chosen them well and are looking forward to what you’ll build together. But now the easy part is done (hiring), you have to build that distributed team as a cohesive unit.
This is a challenge that all teams have, it isn’t specific to distributed team. But it is a challenge that all distributed team knows they need to tackle.</description>

      <description>There’s a world of difference between a 100% remote business and a business where remote work is the exception. If you work remotely and are in that 2nd group, here are 7 tips to help you succeed in that situation.
Look for a 100% remote environment, or at least a remote friendly place
Might seem obvious, but isn’t. You have many reasons to work where you’re working. So think about this, be honest with yourself, and verify if it is really worth it.</description>

      <description>For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.
As the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected.</description>

      <title>Remote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All</title>

      <description>No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!
There are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :
 They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.</description>

      <description>Learning comes from all activities, and interacting with children actually teach you many great lessons applicable to leadership. Or is it the other way around? That’s a debate for another day. Whether you have kids or not, those lessons are relevant for anyone in a leadership position or looking for it.
When you say you’ll do something, do it.
Best way to gain trust, respect and credibility is to do what you’ve told you’ll do.</description>

      <title>The Most Valuable and Underrated Books for Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/the-most-valuable-and-underrated-books-for-software-engineers/</link>

      <description>You want to become a better software engineer. You learn new tech stack, you do hackathon, you’ve read Code Complete twice and follow Kent Beck on Twitter. That’s all good. But focusing only on the technical side is a mistake.
It is important to do cross-domain learning as well. Arts, fiction, biology, physics, woodworking, etc. By learning from other domains, you look at similar problems or concepts from a different point of view.</description>
