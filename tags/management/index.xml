      <description>No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!
There are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :
 They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.</description>

      <description>The Problem
We were working on a critical project, with a huge emphasis put on delivering on time. I realized that the critical nature combined with the time bound constraint was causing some stress for the team.

I knew that if the stress wasn’t relieved, we wouldn’t be able to succeed.</description>

      <description>Everything starts for good reasons. When you start a new project, getting a cadence, a sense of progress, a way to see the journey done so far and what lies ahead provide benefits. But has you progress, it is time to revisit this cadence.
 Choosing a sprint length at the start of each sprint is a waste of energy. Experiment with a couple of lengths, make a decision, and stick with it until there is a significant reason to change.</description>
