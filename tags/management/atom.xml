      <description>I started a newsletter almost one year ago, and I have really enjoyed doing that. It&amp;rsquo;s a great way to discuss and share insights on product engineering, leadership, and personnel growth. I&amp;rsquo;m also sharing articles, events, and any other interesting tidbits I find.
Past editions aren&amp;rsquo;t available online, and while some parts may not be relevant (such as events), it would be interesting to summarize a few of them into a single blog post.</description>

      <description>Setting goals is a fundamental part of personal and professional growth. Whether you aim to launch a new product, improve a key business metric, or achieve a personal milestone, defining your goals can make or break your chances of success.
Surprisingly, the most significant contributor to achieving your goals isn&amp;rsquo;t just hard work or resources—it&amp;rsquo;s how you define those goals in the first place.
This article will explain a simple yet powerful framework for evaluating and defining your goals.</description>

      <description>An essential part of engineering leadership is continuous education. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop learning. Tech and markets are moving fast, and to navigate these changes and ensure your engineering organization is performing at its best, you must continuously improve.
A part of my continuous self-education is reading books—many books. Most were good, some were disappointing, and a few were outstanding.
From what I&amp;rsquo;ve read this year, here are my top 5 books I&amp;rsquo;d recommend to all engineering leaders and why.</description>

      <description>Time flies, competition moves, and money runs out. This environment is the harsh reality that every startup confronts. With countless tasks to accomplish and limited resources, startups are perpetually in a race against time. The question is not whether you can do everything—you can&amp;rsquo;t—but how do you decide what to do first?
The art of prioritization is crucial for startup success, yet it must be more widely recognized and done appropriately.</description>

      <title>Decoding Success and Failure: A Rational Approach</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/decoding-success-and-failure-a-rational-approach/</link>

      <description>In the ever-evolving world of software engineering, we are often presented with the challenge of assessing successes and failures. When evaluating our own performance, we frequently attribute our successes to our skills and our failures to bad luck. However, when it comes to evaluating the results of our competitors, the tendency is quite the opposite: we tend to ascribe their failures to a lack of skill and their successes to sheer luck.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Grey: A Probabilistic Approach to Engineering Decision-Making</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of successes and failures in the world of technology. Throughout the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across various approaches to decision-making and problem-solving, each with its own set of principles and methodologies. However, one idea that recently struck a chord with me is the concept of &amp;ldquo;thinking in bets&amp;rdquo; as outlined by Annie Duke in her book of the same name.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore how this concept can revolutionize the way we make decisions in the field of software engineering and challenge the conventional wisdom that often prevails.</description>

      <title>Remote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All</title>

      <description>No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!
There are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :
 They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.</description>

      <title>Finding the Best Standup Setup for Your Team</title>

      <description>The Problem
We were working on a critical project, with a huge emphasis put on delivering on time. I realized that the critical nature combined with the time bound constraint was causing some stress for the team. The team needed to be focus on the goals we had instead of worried about possible outcomes and other conjectures. I knew that if the stress wasn’t relieved, we wouldn’t be able to succeed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fixed Sprint Duration</title>

      <description>Everything starts for good reasons. When you start a new project, getting a cadence, a sense of progress, a way to see the journey done so far and what lies ahead provide benefits. But has you progress, it is time to revisit this cadence.
 Choosing a sprint length at the start of each sprint is a waste of energy. Experiment with a couple of lengths, make a decision, and stick with it until there is a significant reason to change.</description>
