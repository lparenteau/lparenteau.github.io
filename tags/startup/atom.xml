      <description>As a leader, your mindset can make all the difference between success and failure. Having a consistently positive, optimistic attitude is crucial - it helps you overcome challenges, discover novel solutions, and inspire your team. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a fine line to walk between productive positivity and the dangerous pitfalls of wishful thinking or willful blindness.
 &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not about having a positive attitude, it&amp;rsquo;s about having the right positive attitude.&amp;rdquo; - Jim Collins, author of Good to Great</description>

      <description>Time flies, competition moves, and money runs out. This environment is the harsh reality that every startup confronts. With countless tasks to accomplish and limited resources, startups are perpetually in a race against time. The question is not whether you can do everything—you can&amp;rsquo;t—but how do you decide what to do first?
The art of prioritization is crucial for startup success, yet it must be more widely recognized and done appropriately.</description>

      <description>In startups, rapid growth is the holy grail. Founders dream of the day their company takes off, experiencing exponential user growth, revenue, and market share. However, this dream scenario comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for engineering teams. Recently, I had an enlightening conversation with the head of engineering at a young startup experiencing this very situation. Their story is a valuable lesson for engineering leaders facing similar challenges in fast-growing environments.</description>

      <description>In the fast-paced world of technology and innovation, engineering leaders often navigate complex challenges and make critical decisions that impact their teams, projects, and organizations. While strategy is commonly associated with business executives, it&amp;rsquo;s equally crucial for engineering leaders to grasp and apply strategic thinking within their domain. Understanding strategy and its application can significantly enhance your effectiveness in navigating the complexities of your role and driving success for your organization.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the Indian story of the man who asked for his reward to be 1 grain of wheat placed on the 1st square of a chessboard and doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square. While there are only 64 squares, you&amp;rsquo;d need 2,000 times the world&amp;rsquo;s wheat production to provide that reward. This famous story shows our lack of intuition about exponential growth and its power.</description>

      <description>Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Wisdom Peak, there reigned a king known for his wisdom and prudence. This king, by the name of Han, dwelled in a magnificent palace nestled atop the tallest mountain in the realm. To reach his palace, one had to navigate a treacherous path that wound its way up the steep slopes.
Accompanying King Han on his journey were his two trusted advisors: the elder sage, Master Li, and the younger scholar, Apprentice Zhou.</description>

      <title>Picking the Right Tool for a Remote Engineering Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/picking-the-right-tool-for-a-remote-engineering-team/</link>

      <description>The Problem
When you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.
Actions Taken
My first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t.</description>

      <title>Minimal Tool Box for Remote Startups</title>

      <description>For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.
As the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected.</description>

      <title>Building Your Initial Engineering Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/building-your-initial-engineering-team/</link>

      <guid>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/building-your-initial-engineering-team/</guid>
      <description>The Problem
When I joined an early stage startup as the first engineer, one of my goals was to build out the initial engineering team we needed. Building that initial engineering team is really critical and it must be done right. Having an initial team that is great (or bad) will have a huge impact on the startup as a whole. So I had to be sure I was building the right team.</description>
