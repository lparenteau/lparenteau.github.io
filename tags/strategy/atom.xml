      <description>In machine learning (core to neural network, AI, and LLM), gradient descent is a robust optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It works by iteratively stepping toward the steepest descent, gradually honing in on the optimal solution.
In the startup world, founders embark on a journey to find product/market fit (PMF)—that magical inflection point where their product perfectly satisfies a strong market demand. This process often involves continuous iteration, pivoting when necessary, and refining their offering based on market feedback.</description>

      <description>Time flies, competition moves, and money runs out. This environment is the harsh reality that every startup confronts. With countless tasks to accomplish and limited resources, startups are perpetually in a race against time. The question is not whether you can do everything—you can&amp;rsquo;t—but how do you decide what to do first?
The art of prioritization is crucial for startup success, yet it must be more widely recognized and done appropriately.</description>

      <description>In startups, rapid growth is the holy grail. Founders dream of the day their company takes off, experiencing exponential user growth, revenue, and market share. However, this dream scenario comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for engineering teams. Recently, I had an enlightening conversation with the head of engineering at a young startup experiencing this very situation. Their story is a valuable lesson for engineering leaders facing similar challenges in fast-growing environments.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the Indian story of the man who asked for his reward to be 1 grain of wheat placed on the 1st square of a chessboard and doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square. While there are only 64 squares, you&amp;rsquo;d need 2,000 times the world&amp;rsquo;s wheat production to provide that reward. This famous story shows our lack of intuition about exponential growth and its power.</description>
