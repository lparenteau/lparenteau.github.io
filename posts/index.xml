      <title>Decoding Success and Failure: A Rational Approach</title>

      <description>In the ever-evolving world of software engineering, we are often presented with the challenge of assessing successes and failures. When evaluating our own performance, we frequently attribute our successes to our skills and our failures to bad luck. However, when it comes to evaluating the results of our competitors, the tendency is quite the opposite: we tend to ascribe their failures to a lack of skill and their successes to sheer luck.</description>

      <title>Embracing the Grey: A Probabilistic Approach to Engineering Decision-Making</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve seen my fair share of successes and failures in the world of technology. Throughout the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across various approaches to decision-making and problem-solving, each with its own set of principles and methodologies. However, one idea that recently struck a chord with me is the concept of &amp;ldquo;thinking in bets&amp;rdquo; as outlined by Annie Duke in her book of the same name.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore how this concept can revolutionize the way we make decisions in the field of software engineering and challenge the conventional wisdom that often prevails.</description>

      <title>The Power of Simplicity: Why Complex Solutions Aren&#39;t Always Better</title>

      <description>In the world of software engineering, complexity often takes center stage. We celebrate intricate algorithms, sprawling architectures, and convoluted code as signs of expertise. But what if I told you that complexity isn&amp;rsquo;t always the answer? In fact, more often than not, simpler solutions are not only easier to understand and maintain but also more effective in solving real-world problems.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to understand why complexity is alluring. Complex code and systems can make us feel like we&amp;rsquo;re tackling profound problems, and they can impress colleagues and peers.</description>

      <title>Picking the Right Tool for a Remote Engineering Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/picking-the-right-tool-for-a-remote-engineering-team/</link>

      <description>The Problem
When you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.
Actions Taken
My first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t.</description>

      <title>Building a Cohesive Distributed Team</title>

      <description>You’ve hired seven people, spread across 5 different time zones. You’re optimistic about your team; you’ve chosen them well and are looking forward to what you’ll build together. But now the easy part is done (hiring), you have to build that distributed team as a cohesive unit.
This is a challenge that all teams have, it isn’t specific to distributed team. But it is a challenge that all distributed team knows they need to tackle.</description>

      <title>Tips for Remote Workers in Remote-Unfriendly Environments</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/tips-for-remote-workers-in-remote-unfriendly-environments/</link>

      <description>There’s a world of difference between a 100% remote business and a business where remote work is the exception. If you work remotely and are in that 2nd group, here are 7 tips to help you succeed in that situation.
Look for a 100% remote environment, or at least a remote friendly place
Might seem obvious, but isn’t. You have many reasons to work where you’re working. So think about this, be honest with yourself, and verify if it is really worth it.</description>

      <title>Minimal Tool Box for Remote Startups</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/minimal-tool-box-for-remote-startups/</link>

      <guid>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/minimal-tool-box-for-remote-startups/</guid>
      <description>For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.
As the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected.</description>

      <title>Remote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/remote-work-problems-arent-related-to-remote-at-all/</link>

      <description>No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!
There are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :
 They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.</description>

      <title>Building Your Initial Engineering Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/building-your-initial-engineering-team/</link>

      <guid>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/building-your-initial-engineering-team/</guid>
      <description>The Problem
When I joined an early stage startup as the first engineer, one of my goals was to build out the initial engineering team we needed. Building that initial engineering team is really critical and it must be done right. Having an initial team that is great (or bad) will have a huge impact on the startup as a whole. So I had to be sure I was building the right team.</description>

      <title>Intel gathering from the interview process</title>

      <description>The purpose of a job interview is two fold :
 Employer figures out if he wants you You figure out if you want to work with them  Many people forget about that 2nd point, but it is equally important. Now, to figure out if you want to work with them, you can ask questions. But you can also learn a lot from the interview process itself and how its conducted.</description>

      <title>Leadership Lessons from Parenting</title>

      <description>Learning comes from all activities, and interacting with children actually teach you many great lessons applicable to leadership. Or is it the other way around? That’s a debate for another day. Whether you have kids or not, those lessons are relevant for anyone in a leadership position or looking for it.
When you say you’ll do something, do it.
Best way to gain trust, respect and credibility is to do what you’ve told you’ll do.</description>

      <title>Finding the Best Standup Setup for Your Team</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/finding-the-best-standup-setup-for-your-team/</link>

      <description>The Problem
We were working on a critical project, with a huge emphasis put on delivering on time. I realized that the critical nature combined with the time bound constraint was causing some stress for the team. The team needed to be focus on the goals we had instead of worried about possible outcomes and other conjectures. I knew that if the stress wasn’t relieved, we wouldn’t be able to succeed.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fixed Sprint Duration</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/beyond-fixed-sprints-duration/</link>

      <description>Everything starts for good reasons. When you start a new project, getting a cadence, a sense of progress, a way to see the journey done so far and what lies ahead provide benefits. But has you progress, it is time to revisit this cadence.
 Choosing a sprint length at the start of each sprint is a waste of energy. Experiment with a couple of lengths, make a decision, and stick with it until there is a significant reason to change.</description>

      <title>The Most Valuable and Underrated Books for Software Engineers</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/posts/the-most-valuable-and-underrated-books-for-software-engineers/</link>

      <description>You want to become a better software engineer. You learn new tech stack, you do hackathon, you’ve read Code Complete twice and follow Kent Beck on Twitter. That’s all good. But focusing only on the technical side is a mistake.
It is important to do cross-domain learning as well. Arts, fiction, biology, physics, woodworking, etc. By learning from other domains, you look at similar problems or concepts from a different point of view.</description>
