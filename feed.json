Tech and markets are moving fast, and to navigate these changes and ensure your engineering organization is performing at its best, you must continuously improve.\nA part of my continuous self-education is reading books—many books. Most were good, some were disappointing, and a few were outstanding.\nFrom what I\u0026rsquo;ve read this year, here are my top 5 books I\u0026rsquo;d recommend to all engineering leaders and why.\nAn Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management Written by Will Larson, it\u0026rsquo;s a collection of topics (or challenges) related to engineering management. You can read it front to back or pick the part on your challenge. Compared to other management books, it\u0026rsquo;s more hands-on, with practical things you can try. Still, it isn\u0026rsquo;t dogmatic, and Will always shares why he decided to solve a challenge that way.\nOne thing to remember is the underlying assumption (for the whole book) that you are in a company growing fast and hiring a lot. This assumption makes sense if you consider the author\u0026rsquo;s experience at fast-growing startups like Digg and Stripe, which he often refers to. It is always good to consider the context of the experience people share. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean this is terrible advice for a smaller startup or today\u0026rsquo;s environment. But remember to think for yourself and reason about the recommendations before mindlessly doing anything (which he mentions you should do, anyway).\nThe Essential Wooden: A Lifetime of Lessons on Leaders and Leadership This one covers the lessons from John Wooden (a famous basketball coach). The foundations of coaching and leading people are domain agnostic, so lessons from great coaches are suitable in whatever domain you work in. Obviously, the way you adapt and apply the lessons will be different depending on your work environment. As such, this isn\u0026rsquo;t hands-on, but it provides a solid foundation to build your practice.\nOver the years, he came up with his system, called the \u0026ldquo;Pyramid of Success,\u0026rdquo; with his goal being competitive greatness. There are many lessons in there that you see reflected in other coaches' leadership approaches (like Bill Walsh\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Score Take Care of Itself,\u0026rdquo; another great book). This shouldn\u0026rsquo;t come as a surprise, and I believe it is a sign that these are fundamental principles (it would explain why different people discover the same thing leads to success).\nSo, if you want a book that outlines a great approach to becoming a successful leader, it\u0026rsquo;s a great one to pick.\nDesign Is Storytelling You don\u0026rsquo;t often see design books in engineering leadership book lists, but it\u0026rsquo;s a mistake. More engineering leaders should read and be familiar with the design world. While some may say that \u0026ldquo;we have a designer that takes care of that,\u0026rdquo; (which is a bad reason, but let\u0026rsquo;s not argue here), they forget that there are stuff engineers build that has no designer (outside of engineering). Documentation, API, architecture, and system design are all things squarely owned by engineering, and where using design thinking has a lot to offer.\nEllen Lupton focuses on the fact that good design supports a great narrative (or vice versa: starting with the narrative you want leads to better design). If you want people to take certain actions, providing the proper narrative can nudge them in the right direction. Understanding the user\u0026rsquo;s needs through a narrative also helps better understand the needs, which leads to better ways to solve them.\nWhat Is ChatGPT Doing\u0026hellip; and Why Does It Work? I am now going to a more technical topic: AI. Everything is about AI these days. The improvement around LLM (large language model) greatly boosted that topic. Understanding how they work is essential to understanding what they could be used for, where they aren\u0026rsquo;t a good idea, what security risks they pose, and all the other questions one should ask when looking at new technologies.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found Stephen Wolfram\u0026rsquo;s book easy to understand, and it explains the basis of how LLMs work. Also, you can be sure of the technical accuracy coming from him. Since it\u0026rsquo;s available for free online, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason not to read it.

      "title": "Escaping the Valley of Death: Gradient Descent Strategies for Startup Survival",
      "summary": "Explore how viewing your startup strategy through the lens of gradient descent can provide powerful insights and guide your path to success.",
      "content_text": "In machine learning (core to neural network, AI, and LLM), gradient descent is a robust optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. It works by iteratively stepping toward the steepest descent, gradually honing in on the optimal solution.\nIn the startup world, founders embark on a journey to find product/market fit (PMF)—that magical inflection point where their product perfectly satisfies a strong market demand. This process often involves continuous iteration, pivoting when necessary, and refining their offering based on market feedback.\nAt first glance, these two concepts might seem worlds apart. However, upon closer inspection, the parallels between gradient descent and the quest for PMF are not just striking - they\u0026rsquo;re invaluable. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how viewing your startup strategy through the lens of gradient descent can provide powerful insights and guide your path to success in entrepreneurship\u0026rsquo;s complex, often unpredictable landscape.\nCore Concept Finding PMF in a startup is analogous to the gradient descent algorithm used in optimization problems. Both involve iterative improvement and strategies to avoid getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. As such, it is possible to draw parallels between the two. In addition to adding weight to the validity of using an iterative approach to PMF, it can also foster creativity and help us find new ideas to use.\nKey Parallels Iteration  Gradient Descent: Repeatedly update parameters to minimize the cost function. Startup: Continuously refine the product based on market feedback.  Iteration is the heartbeat of both gradient descent and startup development. In gradient descent, the algorithm takes repeated steps to adjust its parameters, aiming to reduce its prediction error (or cost). Similarly, startups engage in a continuous refinement cycle, changing their product or service based on real-world feedback from customers and the market. Just as each step in gradient descent brings the algorithm closer to the optimal solution, each iteration in a startup\u0026rsquo;s journey provides valuable insights and opportunities for improvement\nThe key is to embrace this iterative process, understanding that each \u0026lsquo;step\u0026rsquo; – a product update, a change to the marketing strategy, or an adjustment to the target audience – is an opportunity to get closer to PMF. Both processes rely on feedback loops: gradient descent uses the calculated error to inform its next step, while startups use customer feedback, usage data, and market response to guide their next move. The goal in both cases is to converge on an optimal solution – the minimum cost function or the sweet spot of PMF.\nMultiple Random Initializations  Gradient Descent: Start from different random points to avoid local minima. Startup: Pivot to new ideas or markets when the current approach isn\u0026rsquo;t working.  In gradient descent, starting the algorithm from different random points is a strategy to avoid getting trapped in local minima – suboptimal solutions that appear to be the best in a limited area of the solution space. Similarly, in the startup world, pivoting to new ideas or markets is a way to escape suboptimal business models or product offerings.\nJust as a new starting point in gradient descent can lead to discovering a better global minimum, a pivot in a startup can open up new opportunities and potentially lead to a more successful business model. Both strategies acknowledge that the initial approach might not lead to the best outcome. The algorithm might not find the global minimum from a single starting point in gradient descent. For startups, the initial business idea might not achieve PMF. By being willing to \u0026ldquo;reinitialize\u0026rdquo; – whether restarting the algorithm or pivoting the business – both gradient descent and startups increase their chances of finding the optimal solution.\nThis parallel highlights the importance of flexibility and the willingness to make significant changes when progress stalls. It also underscores the value of experimentation and not being overly committed to a single approach or idea.\nLearning Rate  Gradient Descent: Adjust the step size to balance speed and accuracy. Startup: Manage the pace of changes and resource allocation in product development.  The concept of learning rate applies in both machine learning and startups, emphasizing the balance between speed and accuracy in making adjustments. In machine learning, particularly in gradient descent, the learning rate determines how quickly the model updates its parameters to minimize errors. A high learning rate can lead to overshooting the optimal solution, while a low one may result in slow progress, making it difficult for the model to converge efficiently.\nSimilarly, in a startup, the learning rate reflects the pace of decision-making in product development and resource allocation. Moving too quickly can lead to mistakes or inefficiencies, and moving too slowly can cause missed opportunities. In both cases, the challenge lies in finding the right balance to ensure steady, effective progress.\nMomentum  Gradient Descent: Use past gradients to maintain velocity in a consistent direction. Startup: Build on successful features or strategies, maintaining momentum in promising directions.  In gradient descent, momentum involves using previous gradients to keep the model moving steadily in the right direction. That helps prevent the model from veering off course or getting stuck in small dips, allowing it to gain speed and make more consistent progress toward an optimal solution.\nIn the context of a startup, momentum refers to the ability to capitalize and stay focused on what\u0026rsquo;s working well—whether it\u0026rsquo;s a feature, strategy, or market approach. By continuing to push forward in promising directions (based on data), a startup can build on its successes and maintain growth without losing traction. Both cases highlight how momentum is about sustaining forward movement, whether optimizing algorithms or scaling a business.\nConvergence  Gradient Descent: The algorithm stops when improvements become negligible. Startup: Achieve PMF when customer acquisition and retention stabilize.  Convergence represents the point where progress naturally slows down, marking the achievement of a desired goal. With gradient descent, convergence occurs when the algorithm reaches a point where further updates to the model bring little to no improvement. That means you\u0026rsquo;ve reached the optimal or near-optimal solution, and the learning process can stop.\nIn a startup context, convergence is akin to when there is little to no progress (on important metrics), whatever you try. If you\u0026rsquo;re happy with that point, you\u0026rsquo;ve reached PMF. If not, if the metrics need to improve, you\u0026rsquo;ve reached a local minimum and need to pivot. In algorithms and startups, convergence reflects a state where major adjustments are no longer necessary, as the system or business has found equilibrium.\nCost Function  Gradient Descent: The function to minimize, representing the error or loss. Startup: Metrics indicating distance from PMF (e.g., churn rate, customer acquisition cost).  The cost function plays a key role in both machine learning and startups by providing a way to measure progress and identify areas for improvement. In machine learning, the cost function quantifies the error or loss of the model, serving as the value that gradient descent aims to minimize. As the model learns, it continuously updates to reduce this error, getting closer to an optimal solution.\nFor a startup, the cost function is the critical business metric that indicates how far the company is from achieving PMF. These metrics include customer acquisition cost, churn rate, or lifetime value. Just as minimizing the cost function in machine learning leads to better performance, improving these key metrics in a startup brings the company closer to PMF and sustainable success.\nBatch Size  Gradient Descent: Number of samples used in each iteration (full batch, mini-batch, or stochastic). Startup: Scale of experiments or beta tests (full market launch, limited release, or individual customer feedback).  Batch size refers to the scale at which one tests the change, whether in machine learning or startups. In machine learning, batch size determines how many data samples are processed before the model updates its parameters. That can range from a full batch, where all data is used in each iteration, to mini-batch or stochastic methods, which use smaller groups of data or even single samples to make updates.\nSimilarly, in a startup, batch size is equivalent to the scale of experiments or product testing. A startup might conduct a full market launch, roll out a limited release, or gather feedback from individual customers to refine its product. In both contexts, choosing the right batch size is crucial: too large can slow progress, while too small might not provide enough useful information for meaningful improvements.\nRegularization  Gradient Descent: Techniques to prevent overfitting to training data. Startup: Avoiding over-optimization for a specific customer segment at the expense of broader market appeal.  In gradient descent, regularization refers to techniques that help prevent models from overfitting their training data. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, these methods discourage overly complex models, promoting more straightforward and more generalizable solutions. Common techniques include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which impose different penalties based on the model\u0026rsquo;s parameters. The implementation of regularization allows data scientists to create models that perform well on training data and generalize effectively to unseen data, thereby improving their overall robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.\nRegularization takes on a different but equally important meaning in the startup realm. It involves avoiding over-optimizing for a specific customer segment at the expense of broader market appeal. Just as machine learning models can become too specialized, startups can become overly tailored to a narrow set of early adopters or initial customers. To counter this, startups must balance serving their core customers and ensuring that their product or service remains flexible enough to attract a wider audience. This approach helps them avoid creating solutions that are too niche, ensuring they can scale effectively and adapt to changing market conditions while still meeting the needs of their initial customer base.\nGradient Clipping  Gradient Descent: Limiting gradient magnitude to prevent explosive updates. Startup: Setting boundaries on pivots or changes to maintain consistency with the company\u0026rsquo;s mission.  Gradient clipping serves to maintain stability and consistency in both domains. For gradient descent, gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent explosive updates during the training of neural networks. This method involves limiting the magnitude of gradients to a predetermined threshold. When the gradient\u0026rsquo;s norm exceeds this threshold, it is scaled down to match the maximum allowed value. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with recurrent neural networks or deep architectures, where gradients can become excessively large, leading to unstable training or the exploding gradient problem.\nIn the startup world, that translates to setting boundaries on pivots or changes to maintain consistency with the company\u0026rsquo;s core mission and values. Just as gradient clipping in machine learning prevents drastic, potentially harmful updates, startups use this concept to avoid radical shifts that could alienate their existing customer base or deviate too far from their original vision. This approach allows for necessary adaptations and pivots in response to market feedback or changing conditions but within a controlled range that aligns with the company\u0026rsquo;s fundamental goals and identity.\nBy \u0026ldquo;clipping\u0026rdquo; the magnitude of changes, startups can evolve and improve their offerings while maintaining a coherent brand identity and staying true to their mission, ensuring long-term stability and sustainable growth.\nSimulated Annealing  Optimization: Occasionally accept worse solutions to escape local optima. Startup: Purposefully explore seemingly suboptimal strategies to uncover potential hidden opportunities.  Simulated annealing draws inspiration from the physical process of annealing in metallurgy. The core idea is occasionally embracing worse solutions to escape local optima, thereby increasing the chances of finding a global optimum. At the outset, the algorithm operates at a high \u0026ldquo;temperature,\u0026rdquo; which allows it to accept suboptimal moves with greater frequency. As the process unfolds, this temperature gradually decreases, making it less likely for the algorithm to accept less favorable solutions. This dynamic approach enables a broad exploration of possibilities in the early stages, followed by a more focused refinement of the best options as the search progresses.\nIn the startup arena, this principle translates into a strategic mindset where entrepreneurs intentionally explore paths that may appear suboptimal at first glance. Just as optimization algorithms benefit from accepting worse solutions, startups can gain valuable insights by pursuing unconventional strategies or ideas that don\u0026rsquo;t seem immediately promising. This willingness to experiment encourages creative thinking and fosters innovation, allowing companies to challenge industry norms and discover unique value propositions.\nBy embracing these exploratory efforts, startups increase their likelihood of stumbling upon breakthrough innovations or untapped market segments. While this approach involves some risk, it ultimately empowers entrepreneurs to refine their focus on the most promising opportunities that emerge from their explorations, paving the way for sustainable growth and success.\nPractical Implications The startup journey, like the optimization process in machine learning, is a complex and dynamic endeavor that requires a nuanced approach to success. At the heart of this journey lies the principle of iteration, a fundamental concept that acknowledges the non-linear nature of progress. Entrepreneurs must embrace this reality, understanding that their path will likely involve multiple cycles of refinement and adjustment rather than a straightforward march to success.\nA critical aspect of this iterative process is striking the right balance between exploration and exploitation. Just as gradient descent algorithms in machine learning must navigate between exploring new possibilities and exploiting promising directions, startups face a similar challenge. They must continually seek out novel ideas and approaches while also capitalizing on strategies that show potential. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to recognize when minor iterations no longer yield significant improvements. In such cases, startups may find themselves trapped in a local minimum, necessitating a dramatic pivot to a new idea to achieve their goals.\nThroughout this journey, data-driven decision-making is a compass, guiding the startup toward PMF. By leveraging metrics and customer feedback, entrepreneurs can make informed choices about their direction, much like how gradient descent algorithms use data to navigate the optimization landscape. This approach should be coupled with adaptive strategies, allowing the startup to adjust its course in response to new information and changing circumstances, mirroring the adaptive learning rates used in advanced optimization algorithms.\nWhile persistence is valuable, it\u0026rsquo;s equally essential for startups to avoid premature convergence on a suboptimal solution. The willingness to make bold moves, akin to re-initializations in optimization algorithms, can be crucial when progress stalls. That might involve significant pivots or complete overhauls of the business model if the current approach proves inadequate.\nThe concept of controlled experimentation, inspired by the \u0026ldquo;batch size\u0026rdquo; thinking in machine learning, offers a framework for determining the scale and scope of product releases and market tests. By carefully calibrating the size and frequency of these experiments, startups can gather meaningful data while managing risk, allowing for more efficient and effective iteration toward their ultimate goals.\nConclusion By comparing the startup journey with gradient descent, entrepreneurs can gain new perspectives on navigating the complex product development landscape and market fit. This analogy provides a framework for strategic thinking and decision-making in the uncertain world of startups.\n",

In addition to adding weight to the validity of using an iterative approach to PMF, it can also foster creativity and help us find new ideas to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"key-parallels\"\u003eKey Parallels\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"iteration\"\u003eIteration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Repeatedly update parameters to minimize the cost function.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Continuously refine the product based on market feedback.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIteration is the heartbeat of both gradient descent and startup development. In gradient descent, the algorithm takes repeated steps to adjust its parameters, aiming to reduce its prediction error (or cost). Similarly, startups engage in a continuous refinement cycle, changing their product or service based on real-world feedback from customers and the market. Just as each step in gradient descent brings the algorithm closer to the optimal solution, each iteration in a startup\u0026rsquo;s journey provides valuable insights and opportunities for improvement\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key is to embrace this iterative process, understanding that each \u0026lsquo;step\u0026rsquo; – a product update, a change to the marketing strategy, or an adjustment to the target audience – is an opportunity to get closer to PMF. Both processes rely on feedback loops: gradient descent uses the calculated error to inform its next step, while startups use customer feedback, usage data, and market response to guide their next move. The goal in both cases is to converge on an optimal solution – the minimum cost function or the sweet spot of PMF.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"multiple-random-initializations\"\u003eMultiple Random Initializations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Start from different random points to avoid local minima.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Pivot to new ideas or markets when the current approach isn\u0026rsquo;t working.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn gradient descent, starting the algorithm from different random points is a strategy to avoid getting trapped in local minima – suboptimal solutions that appear to be the best in a limited area of the solution space. Similarly, in the startup world, pivoting to new ideas or markets is a way to escape suboptimal business models or product offerings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust as a new starting point in gradient descent can lead to discovering a better global minimum, a pivot in a startup can open up new opportunities and potentially lead to a more successful business model. Both strategies acknowledge that the initial approach might not lead to the best outcome. The algorithm might not find the global minimum from a single starting point in gradient descent. For startups, the initial business idea might not achieve PMF. By being willing to \u0026ldquo;reinitialize\u0026rdquo; – whether restarting the algorithm or pivoting the business – both gradient descent and startups increase their chances of finding the optimal solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis parallel highlights the importance of flexibility and the willingness to make significant changes when progress stalls. It also underscores the value of experimentation and not being overly committed to a single approach or idea.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"learning-rate\"\u003eLearning Rate\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Adjust the step size to balance speed and accuracy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Manage the pace of changes and resource allocation in product development.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of learning rate applies in both machine learning and startups, emphasizing the balance between speed and accuracy in making adjustments. In machine learning, particularly in gradient descent, the learning rate determines how quickly the model updates its parameters to minimize errors. A high learning rate can lead to overshooting the optimal solution, while a low one may result in slow progress, making it difficult for the model to converge efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, in a startup, the learning rate reflects the pace of decision-making in product development and resource allocation. Moving too quickly can lead to mistakes or inefficiencies, and moving too slowly can cause missed opportunities. In both cases, the challenge lies in finding the right balance to ensure steady, effective progress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"momentum\"\u003eMomentum\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Use past gradients to maintain velocity in a consistent direction.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Build on successful features or strategies, maintaining momentum in promising directions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn gradient descent, momentum involves using previous gradients to keep the model moving steadily in the right direction. That helps prevent the model from veering off course or getting stuck in small dips, allowing it to gain speed and make more consistent progress toward an optimal solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the context of a startup, momentum refers to the ability to capitalize and stay focused on what\u0026rsquo;s working well—whether it\u0026rsquo;s a feature, strategy, or market approach. By continuing to push forward in promising directions (based on data), a startup can build on its successes and maintain growth without losing traction. Both cases highlight how momentum is about sustaining forward movement, whether optimizing algorithms or scaling a business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"convergence\"\u003eConvergence\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: The algorithm stops when improvements become negligible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Achieve PMF when customer acquisition and retention stabilize.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConvergence represents the point where progress naturally slows down, marking the achievement of a desired goal. With gradient descent, convergence occurs when the algorithm reaches a point where further updates to the model bring little to no improvement. That means you\u0026rsquo;ve reached the optimal or near-optimal solution, and the learning process can stop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a startup context, convergence is akin to when there is little to no progress (on important metrics), whatever you try. If you\u0026rsquo;re happy with that point, you\u0026rsquo;ve reached PMF. If not, if the metrics need to improve, you\u0026rsquo;ve reached a local minimum and need to pivot. In algorithms and startups, convergence reflects a state where major adjustments are no longer necessary, as the system or business has found equilibrium.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"cost-function\"\u003eCost Function\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: The function to minimize, representing the error or loss.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Metrics indicating distance from PMF (e.g., churn rate, customer acquisition cost).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cost function plays a key role in both machine learning and startups by providing a way to measure progress and identify areas for improvement. In machine learning, the cost function quantifies the error or loss of the model, serving as the value that gradient descent aims to minimize. As the model learns, it continuously updates to reduce this error, getting closer to an optimal solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a startup, the cost function is the critical business metric that indicates how far the company is from achieving PMF. These metrics include customer acquisition cost, churn rate, or lifetime value. Just as minimizing the cost function in machine learning leads to better performance, improving these key metrics in a startup brings the company closer to PMF and sustainable success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"batch-size\"\u003eBatch Size\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Number of samples used in each iteration (full batch, mini-batch, or stochastic).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Scale of experiments or beta tests (full market launch, limited release, or individual customer feedback).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBatch size refers to the scale at which one tests the change, whether in machine learning or startups. In machine learning, batch size determines how many data samples are processed before the model updates its parameters. That can range from a full batch, where all data is used in each iteration, to mini-batch or stochastic methods, which use smaller groups of data or even single samples to make updates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, in a startup, batch size is equivalent to the scale of experiments or product testing. A startup might conduct a full market launch, roll out a limited release, or gather feedback from individual customers to refine its product. In both contexts, choosing the right batch size is crucial: too large can slow progress, while too small might not provide enough useful information for meaningful improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"regularization\"\u003eRegularization\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Techniques to prevent overfitting to training data.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Avoiding over-optimization for a specific customer segment at the expense of broader market appeal.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn gradient descent, regularization refers to techniques that help prevent models from overfitting their training data. By adding a penalty term to the loss function, these methods discourage overly complex models, promoting more straightforward and more generalizable solutions. Common techniques include L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, which impose different penalties based on the model\u0026rsquo;s parameters. The implementation of regularization allows data scientists to create models that perform well on training data and generalize effectively to unseen data, thereby improving their overall robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegularization takes on a different but equally important meaning in the startup realm. It involves avoiding over-optimizing for a specific customer segment at the expense of broader market appeal. Just as machine learning models can become too specialized, startups can become overly tailored to a narrow set of early adopters or initial customers. To counter this, startups must balance serving their core customers and ensuring that their product or service remains flexible enough to attract a wider audience. This approach helps them avoid creating solutions that are too niche, ensuring they can scale effectively and adapt to changing market conditions while still meeting the needs of their initial customer base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"gradient-clipping\"\u003eGradient Clipping\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradient Descent: Limiting gradient magnitude to prevent explosive updates.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Setting boundaries on pivots or changes to maintain consistency with the company\u0026rsquo;s mission.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGradient clipping serves to maintain stability and consistency in both domains. For gradient descent, gradient clipping is a technique used to prevent explosive updates during the training of neural networks. This method involves limiting the magnitude of gradients to a predetermined threshold. When the gradient\u0026rsquo;s norm exceeds this threshold, it is scaled down to match the maximum allowed value. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with recurrent neural networks or deep architectures, where gradients can become excessively large, leading to unstable training or the exploding gradient problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the startup world, that translates to setting boundaries on pivots or changes to maintain consistency with the company\u0026rsquo;s core mission and values. Just as gradient clipping in machine learning prevents drastic, potentially harmful updates, startups use this concept to avoid radical shifts that could alienate their existing customer base or deviate too far from their original vision. This approach allows for necessary adaptations and pivots in response to market feedback or changing conditions but within a controlled range that aligns with the company\u0026rsquo;s fundamental goals and identity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy \u0026ldquo;clipping\u0026rdquo; the magnitude of changes, startups can evolve and improve their offerings while maintaining a coherent brand identity and staying true to their mission, ensuring long-term stability and sustainable growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"simulated-annealing\"\u003eSimulated Annealing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptimization: Occasionally accept worse solutions to escape local optima.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStartup: Purposefully explore seemingly suboptimal strategies to uncover potential hidden opportunities.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimulated annealing draws inspiration from the physical process of annealing in metallurgy. The core idea is occasionally embracing worse solutions to escape local optima, thereby increasing the chances of finding a global optimum. At the outset, the algorithm operates at a high \u0026ldquo;temperature,\u0026rdquo; which allows it to accept suboptimal moves with greater frequency. As the process unfolds, this temperature gradually decreases, making it less likely for the algorithm to accept less favorable solutions. This dynamic approach enables a broad exploration of possibilities in the early stages, followed by a more focused refinement of the best options as the search progresses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the startup arena, this principle translates into a strategic mindset where entrepreneurs intentionally explore paths that may appear suboptimal at first glance. Just as optimization algorithms benefit from accepting worse solutions, startups can gain valuable insights by pursuing unconventional strategies or ideas that don\u0026rsquo;t seem immediately promising. This willingness to experiment encourages creative thinking and fosters innovation, allowing companies to challenge industry norms and discover unique value propositions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy embracing these exploratory efforts, startups increase their likelihood of stumbling upon breakthrough innovations or untapped market segments. While this approach involves some risk, it ultimately empowers entrepreneurs to refine their focus on the most promising opportunities that emerge from their explorations, paving the way for sustainable growth and success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"practical-implications\"\u003ePractical Implications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe startup journey, like the optimization process in machine learning, is a complex and dynamic endeavor that requires a nuanced approach to success. At the heart of this journey lies the principle of iteration, a fundamental concept that acknowledges the non-linear nature of progress. Entrepreneurs must embrace this reality, understanding that their path will likely involve multiple cycles of refinement and adjustment rather than a straightforward march to success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA critical aspect of this iterative process is striking the right balance between exploration and exploitation. Just as gradient descent algorithms in machine learning must navigate between exploring new possibilities and exploiting promising directions, startups face a similar challenge. They must continually seek out novel ideas and approaches while also capitalizing on strategies that show potential. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to recognize when minor iterations no longer yield significant improvements. In such cases, startups may find themselves trapped in a local minimum, necessitating a dramatic pivot to a new idea to achieve their goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout this journey, data-driven decision-making is a compass, guiding the startup toward PMF. By leveraging metrics and customer feedback, entrepreneurs can make informed choices about their direction, much like how gradient descent algorithms use data to navigate the optimization landscape. This approach should be coupled with adaptive strategies, allowing the startup to adjust its course in response to new information and changing circumstances, mirroring the adaptive learning rates used in advanced optimization algorithms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile persistence is valuable, it\u0026rsquo;s equally essential for startups to avoid premature convergence on a suboptimal solution. The willingness to make bold moves, akin to re-initializations in optimization algorithms, can be crucial when progress stalls. That might involve significant pivots or complete overhauls of the business model if the current approach proves inadequate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of controlled experimentation, inspired by the \u0026ldquo;batch size\u0026rdquo; thinking in machine learning, offers a framework for determining the scale and scope of product releases and market tests. By carefully calibrating the size and frequency of these experiments, startups can gather meaningful data while managing risk, allowing for more efficient and effective iteration toward their ultimate goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy comparing the startup journey with gradient descent, entrepreneurs can gain new perspectives on navigating the complex product development landscape and market fit. This analogy provides a framework for strategic thinking and decision-making in the uncertain world of startups.\u003c/p\u003e\n",

      "content_text": "In tech startups, achieving product-market fit (PMF) is often the difference between success and failure. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the essentials of PMF: what it is, how to recognize it, strategies for achieving it, and why it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to prioritize it over technical improvements. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in.\nRecognizing Product-Market Fit Product-market fit, a term coined by Andy Rachleff, occurs when you have a unique product offering that people desperately want. While there are various metrics to measure PMF, such as customer lifetime value or the \u0026ldquo;40% rule,\u0026rdquo; many engineers don\u0026rsquo;t have access to these data points. So, how can you tell if your product has achieved PMF?\n Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz: \u0026ldquo;You can always feel product/market fit when it\u0026rsquo;s happening. The customers are buying the product just as fast as you can make it \u0026ndash; or usage is growing just as fast as you can add more servers. Money from customers is piling up in your company checking account. You\u0026rsquo;re hiring sales and customer support staff as fast as you can.\u0026rdquo;\n The Feature Request Flow Indicator One practical method for engineers to gauge PMF is observing the flow of feature requests from the product team.\nPre-PMF Stage: This stage is characterized by:\n Rapid influx of new feature ideas Long list of assumed necessary features Frequent additions to target markets or customer segments High pressure for quick delivery  In this stage, the product team throws ideas at the wall to see what sticks. Hopefully, they follow a strategy, but it\u0026rsquo;s all assumptions and hypotheses. They\u0026rsquo;re experimenting with different features, markets, and customer segments to find the right combination that resonates with users. As an engineer, you might feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of new requests and the pressure to deliver quickly.\nPost-PMF Stage: This stage is characterized by:\n Shift towards bug fixes and minor UX improvements Focus on reducing customer friction More cautious approach to big feature launches Increased emphasis on upfront validation and testing  Once you achieve PMF, the focus shifts from rapid experimentation to optimization and scaling. The product team becomes more cautious about introducing significant changes that could disrupt the successful formula they\u0026rsquo;ve found. As an engineer, you likely notice a decrease in the pace of large feature requests and more emphasis on refining the existing product.\nOther Indicators of PMF While the feature request flow is a good indicator, there are other signs that engineers might observe:\nScaling Challenges As your product gains traction, you may encounter scaling issues. While these can be frustrating, they\u0026rsquo;re often a positive sign that your product is in high demand. Remember that you could have scaling challenges without PMF; for instance, if you offer a free trial and many potential customers try but don\u0026rsquo;t convert to paid customers.\nIncrease in Customer Support Queries More users mean more support requests. While potentially stressful, a surge in customer support tickets can indicate growing adoption of your product. The same warning applies: if you have a free trial, this may not indicate PMF.\nOrganic Growth If you notice an increase in user signups or usage without a corresponding increase in marketing efforts, it could be a sign that you\u0026rsquo;re achieving PMF.\nRetention Metrics If you can access this data, improving retention rates can strongly indicate PMF. Users are sticking around because they find your product valuable.\nWhen you notice these signs, along with a slowdown in big feature requests and more time for scalability, refactoring, and quality improvements, it\u0026rsquo;s a strong indication that you\u0026rsquo;ve reached PMF.\nIterating Towards Product-Market Fit Achieving PMF is a complex process. It requires a strategic, iterative approach to product development.\nAs an engineering leader, here\u0026rsquo;s how to navigate this journey effectively.\nInitial Scope Definition and Minimalism Here\u0026rsquo;s a simple 3-steps approach to defining your initial iteration.\nDefine Core Value Understand the problem you\u0026rsquo;re solving and for whom. Ask: What is the primary pain point we\u0026rsquo;re addressing?\nExample: A task management app\u0026rsquo;s core value might be helping users organize and prioritize their work.\nDraw Clear Boundaries Determine the minimum functionality required to test your hypothesis. Be ruthless in cutting features that aren\u0026rsquo;t essential for your core value proposition.\nExample: For the task management app, you might start with just the ability to create, edit, and complete tasks, leaving out features like team collaboration or integrations for the future.\nEmbrace Minimalism Keep your initial implementation as small as possible to reduce development time, minimize complexity and potential bugs, and get features in front of users faster.\n Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn: \u0026ldquo;If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you\u0026rsquo;ve launched too late.\u0026rdquo;\n This approach allows you to validate your ideas quickly and pivot if necessary without investing too much time in features that might not resonate with users.\nFeature Scalability Spectrum For every feature, there\u0026rsquo;s a spectrum of implementation complexities. On one hand, you have a simple version that takes a day to build, and on the other, a fully-fledged version that might take months. The key is to find the right balance.\nExample: Let\u0026rsquo;s consider a user authentication feature. A simple version (1 day) would be a basic email/password login. A complex Version (3 months) would have multi-factor authentication, social logins, password recovery, account merging, etc.\nThe goal is to identify where your implementation should fall on this spectrum. It would be best to aim to provide value quickly while still meeting user needs.\nIterative Development Process  Eric Ries, author of \u0026ldquo;The Lean Startup\u0026rdquo;: \u0026ldquo;The only way to win is to learn faster than anyone else.\u0026rdquo;\n After your launch with a minimal viable feature, where you focussed on delivering the core functionality that addresses your users' primary pain point, it\u0026rsquo;s time to iterate toward PMF.\nGather Feedback You need to collect honest user input and analyze usage patterns. Use quantitative data (usage statistics) and qualitative feedback (user interviews, surveys). Pay attention to what users say and do. Sometimes, user behavior tells a different story than their stated preferences.\nIdentify Opportunities Use data to guide future iterations. Look for patterns in user behavior and feedback. What features are users asking for most frequently? Where are they getting stuck or dropping off? Prioritize improvements that align with your core value proposition and potentially significantly impact user satisfaction or adoption.\nContinuous Improvement Evolve the feature based on actual user needs. Implement improvements in small, manageable chunks. After each iteration, reassess and reprioritize based on new data and feedback.\nAlways ask: \u0026ldquo;Is this the most valuable thing we could provide to our users right now?\u0026rdquo; This question should guide every decision from initial scope to future iterations.\n Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator: \u0026ldquo;Make something people want.\u0026rdquo;\n Remember, the goal isn\u0026rsquo;t to build the perfect feature in isolation. It\u0026rsquo;s to create a living, evolving product that resonates with your users and adapts to their changing needs. By following this iterative, user-centric approach, you\u0026rsquo;re not just developing features but cultivating a product development culture that values rapid delivery, data-driven decision-making, and flexibility in response to user needs.\nThe Importance of Postponing Technical Debt Until After PMF While it might be tempting for engineering leaders to focus on technical aspects like architecture refactoring or tooling improvements, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to prioritize business considerations, especially before reaching PMF.\nUnderstanding the Stakes Before diving into strategies, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to understand why this approach is critical.\nPre-PMF, the business\u0026rsquo;s survival is uncertain—direct all efforts toward proving a market for your product. Time and money spent on technical improvements are resources not spent on finding PMF. Major technical investments might become obsolete if significant pivots are required to achieve PMF.\nPre-PMF Strategy Focus on Business Viability The business\u0026rsquo;s survival is uncertain, so all efforts should be directed towards finding PMF. Prioritize features and improvements that directly contribute to user acquisition, activation, and retention. Be prepared to make technical compromises if they allow you to validate business hypotheses more quickly.\nMinimal Technical Improvements Only tackle low-hanging fruits that bring significant benefits for minimal effort. For example, implementing basic error logging to help diagnose user issues quickly is worth it. However, a dashboard allowing future customer support to know everything a user did is overkill. Avoid large-scale refactoring or architecture changes for the next critical feature unless necessary.\nAvoid Premature Optimization Resist the urge to spend time on significant technical debt or architecture refactoring. It\u0026rsquo;s okay if your code isn\u0026rsquo;t perfect, or you must use \u0026ldquo;quick and dirty\u0026rdquo; solutions to rapidly test ideas. Remember, you can improve the technical foundation later, but only if you build a viable business first.\nMaintain a \u0026ldquo;Technical Debt Backlog\u0026rdquo; While you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t address major technical issues pre-PMF, keeping track of them is valuable. Document technical compromises and areas that will need attention post-PMF. That will help you plan and prioritize once you have the luxury to focus on these issues. Remember that pivots may cause many changes, so don\u0026rsquo;t invest too much in the tooling here, as the content may become obsolete quickly.\nPost-PMF Approach Ample Time for Technical Improvements With a growing customer base, you can justify spending time on architecture refactoring, paying technical debt, and improving tooling. You\u0026rsquo;ll likely have more resources (time, money, personnel) to dedicate to these efforts. Improvements can be planned and executed systematically rather than rushed, ad hoc.\nClear Value Proposition Based on your expanding user base, the value of technical improvements becomes more straightforward to calculate. If a refactoring effort can improve app performance by 20%, you can now quantify the number of users this will positively impact. That makes it easier to justify technical investments to non-technical stakeholders.\nGuaranteed Returns Technical improvements offer more predictable benefits than speculative new features. Investments in scalability, reliability, and developer productivity have clear, measurable outcomes. These improvements directly contribute to your ability to serve your growing user base effectively.\nStrategic Technical Planning Once you achieve PMF, you can plan technical improvements that align with your long-term business strategy. You can make architectural decisions based on your product\u0026rsquo;s and users' proven needs rather than speculative requirements.\nA Shifting Perspective Remember, the issue isn\u0026rsquo;t a lack of time for technical improvements but rather a misalignment of priorities. Focusing first on reaching PMF creates the space and justification for addressing technical debt later.\n Educate your team about this approach to manage expectations and maintain morale. Celebrate the achievement of PMF as a milestone that unlocks the ability to focus on technical excellence. When addressing technical debt post-PMF, approach it strategically, focusing on improvements that will significantly impact your ability to serve users and scale the business.  By postponing major technical debt work until after PMF, you\u0026rsquo;re not neglecting your product\u0026rsquo;s technical health. Instead, you make your technical investments when they provide maximum value to your business and users.\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid in the Quest for Product-Market Fit While pursuing product-market fit, many startups need help overcoming common traps that hinder their progress. Knowing these pitfalls can help you navigate the challenging path to PMF more effectively. Here are some critical mistakes to avoid and how to avoid them.\nPremature Scaling One of the most common mistakes is scaling your team or operations before achieving PMF. That can quickly deplete your resources without providing the necessary insights to improve your product.\nKeep your team lean and focused on learning and iterating to avoid this until you have clear evidence of PMF.\nIgnoring Customer Feedback Some founders become too attached to their original vision and fail to listen to what their customers say.\nAvoid this by regularly engaging with your users, conducting surveys, and being open to pivoting based on feedback.\nFocusing on Vanity Metrics Metrics like total signups or page views can be misleading. They might make you feel good but don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily indicate PMF.\nConcentrate on actionable metrics demonstrating real user engagement and value, such as retention rates or the percentage of power users, to avoid this.\nOver-engineering the Product In the pursuit of perfection, some teams spend too much time adding features or polishing the product before validating its market need.\nTo avoid this, embrace the minimum viable product approach and iterate based on user feedback rather than assumptions.\nNeglecting the Business Model Some startups focus solely on user growth without considering how they\u0026rsquo;ll monetize their product.\nAvoid this by incorporating your business model into your PMF considerations from the start. Ensure that your product solves a problem and does so in a way that users are willing to pay for.\nMistaking Early Adopters for the Mass Market Early success with enthusiastic early adopters doesn\u0026rsquo;t always translate to broader market appeal.\nAvoid this by continuously validating your product with new user segments and being prepared to adapt as you move beyond early adopters.\nSolving a Non-existent Problem Sometimes, founders fall in love with a solution without thoroughly validating that the problem it solves is significant enough for users to care.\nAvoid this by conducting thorough market research and problem validation before and during product development.\nIneffective Communication of Value Proposition Even if you have a great product, you must communicate its value to achieve PMF.\nAvoid this by refining your messaging and conveying your unique value proposition in all your marketing and product materials.\nBy being aware of these common pitfalls, you can focus more effectively on the critical path to product-market fit. Remember, the journey to PMF is rarely linear, and being adaptable while avoiding these mistakes can significantly improve your chances of success.\nConclusion Achieving product-market fit is a critical milestone for any startup. By recognizing the signs of PMF, adopting an iterative, user-centric approach to development, and strategically postponing significant technical improvements, you can navigate the challenging path to creating a product that resonates with your market. Remember, the goal isn\u0026rsquo;t perfection from the start but making a living, evolving product that adapts to user needs and grows strategically. That\u0026rsquo;s the key to success in today\u0026rsquo;s dynamic software landscape.\n",

This is where a positive, optimistic attitude becomes crucial.\nTake the example of a tech startup founder developing a groundbreaking new software platform. There\u0026rsquo;s no precedent to reference, so she has to approach the project with a mindset of possibility and determination.

He may have started out with great enthusiasm, certain that his proven business model would translate seamlessly. But once he has sales data, customer feedback, and operational metrics from the new locations, he has to be willing to objectively evaluate whether his initial assumptions were correct.

Ignoring those insights in favor of blind optimism would be a recipe for disaster.\n \u0026ldquo;Data doesn\u0026rsquo;t lie, but people often do.\u0026rdquo; - Nate Silver, statistician and author\n The key is to avoid the siren song of ungrounded positivity.

Things have to change first based on the data you just got.\nOne of the most effective ways to guard against this is to seek an outside, neutral perspective. An unbiased third party, unencumbered by the emotional attachment and preconceptions that can cloud a leader\u0026rsquo;s judgment, can provide invaluable insight. They can help expose the reality of the situation, reveal blind spots, and offer fresh ideas for moving forward.\nFor example, a marketing executive leading a major rebrand might invite a panel of industry experts to audit her plans and provide feedback. Their outsider perspective could uncover flaws in her assumptions or highlight opportunities she had overlooked. Embracing that constructive criticism, rather than stubbornly defending her original vision, is what will position her for long-term success.\n \u0026ldquo;Everybody has a blind spot. That\u0026rsquo;s why it\u0026rsquo;s critical to surround yourself with people who will give you honest feedback. They can see what you can\u0026rsquo;t see.\u0026rdquo; - Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Meta\n In the end, the most successful leaders strike a delicate balance.

      "summary": "Maximize your startup's chances of success by mastering the critical skill of effective prioritization.",
      "content_text": "Time flies, competition moves, and money runs out. This environment is the harsh reality that every startup confronts. With countless tasks to accomplish and limited resources, startups are perpetually in a race against time. The question is not whether you can do everything—you can\u0026rsquo;t—but how do you decide what to do first?\nThe art of prioritization is crucial for startup success, yet it must be more widely recognized and done appropriately. Many founders fell into the trap of trying to do everything at once or following their gut instincts, leading to wasted efforts and missed opportunities.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s the good news: prioritizing doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be complicated. It\u0026rsquo;s easier than most people think. Let me introduce you to a simple, practical framework to help you align your efforts with your goals and maximize your limited resources.\nThe Simple Prioritization Framework Define Your Goals Before prioritizing anything, you need to know what you\u0026rsquo;re aiming for. What are your objectives? Are you trying to acquire more users, increase revenue, improve product features, or something else? If you still need to clearly define your goals, stop everything else and do this first. Without clear objectives, any attempt at prioritization is just guesswork.\nExample: Let\u0026rsquo;s say you\u0026rsquo;re running a SaaS startup, and your goals are\n Increase Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) by 20% in the next quarter Reduce customer churn rate from 5% to 3% Launch a mobile app version of your product  List and Rate Work Items Now, create a single-column list of all your work items. It could include developing new features, running marketing campaigns, making hiring decisions, etc. Rate each item based on how much it contributes to your goals. You can use a simple scale like 1-5, where one means it barely contributes and 5 means it significantly contributes.\nExample:\n   Work Item MRR Goal Churn Goal Mobile App Goal Total Score     Implement a new pricing tier 5 2 1 8   Develop customer onboarding 3 5 1 9   Build mobile app MVP 2 3 5 10   Launch email re-engagement campaign 4 4 1 9   Hire additional developer 3 2 4 9    Sort and Refine Sort your list based on the total scores. For items with the same score, manually rank them based on your judgment. Remember, no two items can have the same final rank.\nExample: Based on the scoring and manually ranking items of the same score, we get\n Build mobile app MVP (10) Develop customer onboarding (9) Launch email re-engagement campaign (9) Hire additional developer (9) Implement a new pricing tier (8)  Check for Dependencies Review your sorted list and look for dependencies. If a higher-ranked depends on a lower-ranged item, move it up accordingly.\nExample: You realize that you must hire an additional developer to build the mobile app MVP effectively. Your refined list might look like this:\n Hire additional developer Build mobile app MVP Develop customer onboarding Launch email re-engagement campaign Implement a new pricing tier  That\u0026rsquo;s it! This prioritized list is your roadmap. Focus on completing the first item before moving to the next.\nPutting the Framework into Action Let\u0026rsquo;s walk through a real-world scenario to see how someone can use this framework.\nImagine you\u0026rsquo;re running a fitness app startup. Your app provides personalized workout plans, but user retention has been challenging. After some market research, you\u0026rsquo;ve identified several potential improvements and initiatives. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you might apply the prioritization framework:\nDefine Your Goals\n Increase user retention rate from 20% to 40% in 3 months Boost daily active users by 50% in the next quarter Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50 within six months  List and Rate Work Items\n   Work Item Retention Active Users NPS Total     Add social features 4 5 3 12   Improve UI/UX 3 4 5 12   Integrate with wearables 5 3 4 12   Launch referral program 2 5 3 10   Develop video tutorials 4 3 4 11   Implement push notifications 5 4 2 11    Sort and Refine\n Add social features (12) Integrate with wearables (12) Improve UI/UX (12) Implement push notifications (11) Develop video tutorials (11) Launch referral program (10)  Check for Dependencies\nYou realize that improving the UI/UX should come before adding social features or integrating with wearables, as it will enhance the impact of these features. The final prioritized list looks like this:\n Improve UI/UX Add social features Integrate with wearables Implement push notifications Develop video tutorials Launch referral program  This prioritized list now gives you a clear roadmap of what to tackle first to achieve your goals most effectively.\nThe Power of Simplicity It is tempting to add more complexity to this system—perhaps by assigning different weights to goals or using a more intricate scoring system. While these can be valid sometimes, remember that complexity doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily lead to better results. The power of this framework lies in its simplicity and adaptability.\nStaying on Track As you work through your prioritized list, you might want to start on a lower-ranked item. When this happens, it signals you to revisit your goals and rating system. Are you trying to accomplish an unstated goal? If so, add it to your list of objectives and redo the exercise. Does your weighting system need adjustment? Make the changes and reprioritize. As long as you are focussing 100% on the work item that will create the most value, you\u0026rsquo;re working on the right thing.\nThe key is to maintain a single column of prioritized work items, each with a unique priority. Anything else will slow down your progress toward your goals, delay value delivery, and postpone the validation of your hypotheses.\nRemember, if you don\u0026rsquo;t explicitly decide on this prioritized list of work items, you leave your startup\u0026rsquo;s success up to chance. In the fast-paced, high-stakes world of startups, that\u0026rsquo;s a risk you can\u0026rsquo;t afford to take.\nConclusion Prioritization is not just about doing the right things—it\u0026rsquo;s about doing the right things to quickly bring in the most value. Using this simple framework, you can ensure that every hour of work and every dollar spent efficiently moves you closer to your goals.\nUltimately, successful prioritization comes down to clarity of goals, honest assessment of tasks, and the discipline to stick to your priorities. Master this, and you\u0026rsquo;ll be well-equipped to navigate the challenges of the startup world, making the most of your limited time and resources.\nRemember, in the world of startups, it\u0026rsquo;s not the biggest or the strongest that survive—it\u0026rsquo;s those who can adapt and prioritize effectively. So, what\u0026rsquo;s at the top of your priority list?\n",

      "content_text": "In startups, rapid growth is the holy grail. Founders dream of the day their company takes off, experiencing exponential user growth, revenue, and market share. However, this dream scenario comes with its own set of challenges, particularly for engineering teams. Recently, I had an enlightening conversation with the head of engineering at a young startup experiencing this very situation. Their story is a valuable lesson for engineering leaders facing similar challenges in fast-growing environments.egy and its application can significantly enhance your effectiveness in navigating the complexities of your role and driving success for your organization.\nThe Challenge of Legacy Architecture As is often the case with startups, this company\u0026rsquo;s current architecture resulted from numerous pivots and repurposed code from their early days. This approach was appropriate during the initial stages, where speed and flexibility were paramount. The mantra \u0026ldquo;optimize for speed until you achieve product-market fit\u0026rdquo; is a well-established principle in the startup world.\nHowever, once a startup hits its growth phase, this cobbled-together architecture can become a significant hindrance. The question then becomes: how do you tackle this technical debt while maintaining the momentum of your growth?\nThe Power of Simple Models At this stage in a startup\u0026rsquo;s journey, there\u0026rsquo;s usually a clearer understanding of what the product needs to support, what can be left behind, and how the product will likely evolve. This clarity provides the perfect opportunity to build a simple model of your product architecture based on current knowledge.\nThe key here is to keep the model as simple as possible. This simplicity offers several benefits:\n Easy to Understand: All team members can quickly grasp a simple model, from new hires to seasoned veterans. Mental Portability: People can always keep the entire model in their heads, facilitating quicker decision-making and problem-solving. Future-Proofing: It provides straightforward answers for future additions to the product, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Improved Communication: Simple models enhance communication between teams and stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings and aligning efforts.  Implementing Simplification Gradually It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that you can start simplifying once you have a few things figured out. If there are areas where you need clarification on the best model or description, that\u0026rsquo;s okay. You can approach the process of simplification incrementally:\n Start Small: Begin with one part of your solution that you understand well and feel confident about simplifying. Iterate: As you progress and learn from the initial simplification efforts, you can extend the process to other areas of your system. Continuous Refinement: As your understanding evolves, so too can your models. Revisit and refine your simplified models over time as needed.  Expanding the Scope of Simplification The principle of simplification extends beyond just your product architecture. As an engineering leader, you should look for opportunities to simplify across various aspects of your organization:\n Tech Stack: Can you consolidate or standardize technologies on fewer, more versatile tools? Processes: Are there ways to streamline your development, testing, or deployment processes? Organizational Structure: Can you simplify reporting lines or team structures to improve communication and decision-making? Documentation: Is there an opportunity to create more precise, concise documentation that\u0026rsquo;s easier to maintain and use? Codebase: Can you refactor complex areas of your codebase to improve readability and maintainability?  The Importance of Pausing to Think As an engineering leader in a fast-growing startup, I quickly feel overwhelmed by the constant flow of tasks and challenges. Pausing to think and strategize might seem like a luxury you can\u0026rsquo;t afford. However, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that you have the authority and responsibility to create this space for strategic thinking as a leader.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t take the time to step back and consider the bigger picture, things will not magically improve. They\u0026rsquo;re likely to get worse over time as complexity compounds. So, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to:\n Identify Pain Points: Pause and think about which part of your organization (code, architecture, process, etc.) is causing the most frustration. Envision Simplification: Consider how you could simplify this area. What simple model could fulfill the need while reducing complexity at the same time? Plan Implementation: Develop a strategy for implementing these simplifications without disrupting ongoing work. Communicate the Vision: Share your simplification plans with your team, explaining the benefits and getting their buy-in.  The Long-Term Impact of Simplification Removing complexity and using simple models is about more than just solving immediate problems. It\u0026rsquo;s a strategy that allows your engineering organization to scale effectively. Without this approach, you risk getting stuck in a quagmire of complexity where adding more people to the team doesn\u0026rsquo;t solve problems – it creates new ones.\nSimplification enables:\n Faster Onboarding: New team members can get up to speed more quickly when systems and processes are more straightforward. Improved Productivity: Less time spent navigating complex systems, allowing more focus on valuable work. Better Quality: Simpler systems are easy to test, debug, and maintain, leading to higher-quality outputs. Increased Agility: When your systems and processes are more straightforward, it\u0026rsquo;s easier to pivot or make changes as needed. Enhanced Innovation: With less cognitive load spent on managing complexity, your team has more capacity for creative problem-solving and innovation.  Conclusion As your startup grows, the complexity of your systems and processes will naturally increase. However, by simplifying your architecture, tech stack, processes, and organizational structure, you can manage this complexity and set your engineering team up for sustainable growth.\nRemember, simplification is an ongoing process, not a one-time task. Regularly step back, assess your current state, and look for opportunities to simplify. By doing so, you\u0026rsquo;ll create an engineering organization that\u0026rsquo;s more efficient, innovative, and better equipped to handle the challenges of rapid growth.\nIn the fast-paced world of startups, the ability to simplify might be your most valuable skill as an engineering leader. Embrace it, practice it, and watch your team thrive amidst the chaos of growth.\n",

      "content_text": "In the fast-paced world of technology and innovation, engineering leaders often navigate complex challenges and make critical decisions that impact their teams, projects, and organizations. While strategy is commonly associated with business executives, it\u0026rsquo;s equally crucial for engineering leaders to grasp and apply strategic thinking within their domain. Understanding strategy and its application can significantly enhance your effectiveness in navigating the complexities of your role and driving success for your organization.\nUnderstanding Strategy First, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to know what strategy truly is. Like many other words, people often misuse the term \u0026ldquo;strategy,\u0026rdquo; many things labeled with it are not strategies. I prefer Roger Martin\u0026rsquo;s simple yet powerful definition:\n \u0026ldquo;A strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.\u0026rdquo;\n Let\u0026rsquo;s break this definition down and explore its components.\nClear Goal (Winning) When discussing winning, you need a clear goal to know what winning means. For an engineering leader, this could be various objectives:\n Delivering a groundbreaking product ahead of competitors Achieving a specific level of system reliability or performance Reducing technical debt by a certain percentage Improving team productivity and satisfaction  Example: Imagine you\u0026rsquo;re the CTO of a startup aiming to disrupt the ride-sharing industry. Your \u0026ldquo;win\u0026rdquo; might be defined as launching a platform that can handle 100,000 concurrent users with 99.99% uptime within 18 months.\nDefined Playing Field The playing field is the boundaries or the context within which you want to win. Others don\u0026rsquo;t define this; you have to decide the playing field. That decision is an integral part of the strategy, and you can specify that any way you want.\nExample: Continuing with our ride-sharing startup, you might define your playing field as \u0026ldquo;urban areas in North America with populations over 500,000.\u0026rdquo; This choice narrows your focus and impacts everything from your technology stack to your hiring decisions.\nThe \u0026ldquo;How\u0026rdquo; (Theory of Winning) Finally, you need the \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; to achieve that goal on that playing field. The \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; needs to be based on a theory (or hypothesis) you have that, if correct, guarantees you to win.\nExample: Your theory of winning might be: \u0026ldquo;By leveraging a serverless architecture and machine learning for predictive scaling, we can achieve superior performance and cost-efficiency compared to traditional server-based solutions, allowing us to undercut competitors' prices while maintaining high reliability.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Integrative Nature of Strategy The whole thing must be cohesive; each point will influence the rest. Each point should reinforce or help each other. This integrative nature sets actual strategy apart from a mere collection of goals or tactics.\nExample: In our ride-sharing scenario, the choice of urban areas (playing field) influences the technical requirements (how), affecting your goal\u0026rsquo;s timeline and scale. If you were to change any of these elements, it would necessitate adjustments to the others to maintain a coherent strategy.\nInsights from \u0026ldquo;Good Strategy / Bad Strategy\u0026rdquo; Richard Rumelt, in his seminal work \u0026ldquo;Good Strategy / Bad Strategy,\u0026quot; provides valuable insights that complement our understanding of strategy. One particularly relevant quote from the book is:\n \u0026ldquo;The core of strategy work is always the same: discovering the critical factors in a situation and designing a way of coordinating and focusing actions to deal with those factors.\u0026rdquo;\n This quote emphasizes the analytical and creative aspects of strategy formulation. For engineering leaders, this means:\n Analytical Aspect: Identifying the critical factors in your technological landscape, market position, and organizational capabilities. Creative Aspect: Designing a coordinated approach that leverages these factors to achieve your goals.  Example: Consider a mid-sized software company facing increasing competition from established players and innovative startups. The critical factors might include:\n Rapid technological change in their industry Growing customer demand for AI-powered features A talented but overworked engineering team  A good strategy might involve:\n Focusing on a niche where the company\u0026rsquo;s expertise gives them an edge Partnering with an AI research institution to quickly build AI capabilities Implementing an aggressive talent development and retention program  This approach coordinates actions across multiple fronts (market positioning, technology development, and human resources) to address the critical factors identified.\nRumelt\u0026rsquo;s insight reminds us that strategy isn\u0026rsquo;t about platitudes or vague aspirations. It\u0026rsquo;s about clear-eyed analysis followed by focused, coordinated action. For engineering leaders, this means going beyond technical considerations to understand the broader context and designing holistic solutions that address the most crucial challenges and opportunities.\nCharacteristics of a Good Strategy A hallmark of a good strategy is its clarity and coherence. It should be concise enough to fit on a single page and provide quick answers to questions about the best course of action. A well-crafted strategy serves as a guiding framework for decision-making, eliminating the need to decide everything and ensuring the correct path forward becomes evident upon reading the strategy.\nExample: Imagine you need to decide whether to invest in developing a new feature or optimizing existing code. A clear strategy would guide this decision by aligning it with your overarching goals and theory of winning. If your strategy emphasizes rapid scaling and performance, you might prioritize optimization. You might lean towards new feature development if it focuses on market differentiation.\nApplying Strategic Thinking as an Engineering Leader As an engineering leader, where does strategic thinking help? As we\u0026rsquo;ve seen, the goal, the playing field, and the actions are all intertwined and influence each other. To be an effective leader, you need to be able to think about all of them as a whole.\nKeep your thinking open to what actions engineering will take. When you propose a solution or a path forward, suggest (or adjust as needed) a whole strategy. In healthy organizations, this will lead to productive discussions and allow the business to pick the best path forward, leading to success. Otherwise, you may get engineering busy, but the chances of overall success will be, at best, low and, at worst, guaranteed to fail.\nExamples of Strategic Thinking in Engineering Leadership  Technology Stack Selection: Instead of simply choosing the most popular or familiar technologies, a strategic approach would consider the following:   Long-term scalability needs Alignment with company goals (e.g., rapid development vs. rock-solid stability) Available talent pool for hiring Total cost of ownership  Example: A fintech startup might choose a less common but highly secure and auditable technology stack to align with its goal of becoming the most trusted platform in its niche.\nTeam Structure and Hiring: Strategic thinking in team building goes beyond just filling open positions:   Aligning team structure with product architecture Balancing specialization vs. versatility Planning for future skill needs  Example: An AI-focused company might structure its teams around specific AI domains (NLP, computer vision, etc.) rather than traditional software engineering roles to foster deep expertise in its core competencies.\nTechnical Debt Management: A strategic approach to technical debt considers the following:   Impact on future goals and scalability Balance between new feature development and refactoring Alignment with business priorities  Example: A rapidly growing e-commerce platform might strategically decide to accumulate technical debt in non-critical areas to focus on scaling core transaction systems, with a plan to address the debt after achieving its market share goals.\nInnovation and Research: Strategic innovation isn\u0026rsquo;t about chasing every new technology:   Aligning research with long-term company vision Balancing exploration of new technologies with exploitation of existing strengths Creating a culture that supports purposeful innovation  Example: An enterprise software company might strategically invest in researching AI-driven user interfaces, seeing them as key to leapfrogging competitors in user experience, even if the immediate ROI isn\u0026rsquo;t clear.\nConclusion As an engineering leader, embracing strategic thinking can elevate your impact beyond day-to-day technical decisions. By understanding and applying the principles of good strategy – setting clear goals, defining your playing field, and developing a coherent theory of winning – you can guide your team and organization toward meaningful, lasting success.\nRemember, strategy isn\u0026rsquo;t about predicting the future or creating rigid plans. It\u0026rsquo;s about making integrated choices that position you to win in your chosen arena. By cultivating this strategic mindset, you\u0026rsquo;ll be better equipped to navigate the complex landscape of modern technology leadership, drive innovation, and create value in ways that truly matter.\n",

Otherwise, you may get engineering busy, but the chances of overall success will be, at best, low and, at worst, guaranteed to fail.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"examples-of-strategic-thinking-in-engineering-leadership\"\u003eExamples of Strategic Thinking in Engineering Leadership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnology Stack Selection:\nInstead of simply choosing the most popular or familiar technologies, a strategic approach would consider the following:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLong-term scalability needs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlignment with company goals (e.g., rapid development vs. rock-solid stability)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAvailable talent pool for hiring\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTotal cost of ownership\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e A fintech startup might choose a less common but highly secure and auditable technology stack to align with its goal of becoming the most trusted platform in its niche.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTeam Structure and Hiring:\nStrategic thinking in team building goes beyond just filling open positions:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAligning team structure with product architecture\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBalancing specialization vs. versatility\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePlanning for future skill needs\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e An AI-focused company might structure its teams around specific AI domains (NLP, computer vision, etc.) rather than traditional software engineering roles to foster deep expertise in its core competencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTechnical Debt Management:\nA strategic approach to technical debt considers the following:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImpact on future goals and scalability\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBalance between new feature development and refactoring\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlignment with business priorities\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e A rapidly growing e-commerce platform might strategically decide to accumulate technical debt in non-critical areas to focus on scaling core transaction systems, with a plan to address the debt after achieving its market share goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInnovation and Research:\nStrategic innovation isn\u0026rsquo;t about chasing every new technology:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAligning research with long-term company vision\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBalancing exploration of new technologies with exploitation of existing strengths\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCreating a culture that supports purposeful innovation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample:\u003c/strong\u003e An enterprise software company might strategically invest in researching AI-driven user interfaces, seeing them as key to leapfrogging competitors in user experience, even if the immediate ROI isn\u0026rsquo;t clear.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"conclusion\"\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs an engineering leader, embracing strategic thinking can elevate your impact beyond day-to-day technical decisions.

      "content_text": "We\u0026rsquo;ve all heard the Indian story of the man who asked for his reward to be 1 grain of wheat placed on the 1st square of a chessboard and doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square. While there are only 64 squares, you\u0026rsquo;d need 2,000 times the world\u0026rsquo;s wheat production to provide that reward. This famous story shows our lack of intuition about exponential growth and its power.\nSimilarly, James Clear\u0026rsquo;s often shared picture shows that a daily 1% improvement will result in ~38X by year-end. This is the same as compounding interest, which shows exponential growth behavior, too.\nThese stories are powerful. I\u0026rsquo;m a big proponent of continuous improvement myself. At the same time, since exponential growth is hard to imagine, I often see people misuse it and reach the wrong conclusion. Exponential growth isn\u0026rsquo;t magic, and if you don\u0026rsquo;t do the math to verify it, you may find yourself in a situation where continuous improvement won\u0026rsquo;t allow you to win. But how so? Let\u0026rsquo;s dig in to see.\nThere are two parts here:\n How significant is the growth at every step (100% in the wheat case, 1% in James Clear\u0026rsquo;s story)? How long do you sustain that growth (64 iterations in the wheat case, 365 iterations in James Clear\u0026rsquo;s story)?  The numbers in the above stories were chosen to show the potential of exponential growth. But the results really depend on these numbers, and they may not be something you have control over in reality.\nWhat if you improve by 1% each week instead of each day? It\u0026rsquo;s no longer the 3,778% improvement you\u0026rsquo;re looking at, but 68% instead. It\u0026rsquo;s still more significant than most would imagine, but it\u0026rsquo;s not even doubling! And that assumes the improvement you\u0026rsquo;re making compound. If you don\u0026rsquo;t have focus and improve in different areas, it will be less than that.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try a small exercise. If a startup has to double its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) (from 2M to 4M) to get its next round of funding, how long does it take to get there if its new ARR doubles every quarter? Only 1 quarter? It\u0026rsquo;s a trick question since you need to know the new ARR (not the total existing ARR) to calculate. Let\u0026rsquo;s assume it was adding 50k new ARR in the first quarter; how to get to the new 2M ARR needed to double? It would take 16 months to get there. A lot longer than 3 months. And this assumes doubling is sustained. Just one quarter with a little less new ARR, and the time it takes will be much longer.\nSo, while exponential growth is incredible, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to put that into perspective and ask the appropriate questions:\n Can we sustain that growth rate? What\u0026rsquo;s the data to date telling us? Is the growth rate slowing down, even just a tiny bit? What\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;honest\u0026rdquo; growth rate we can expect to sustain? How much time do we have to achieve our goal? Can we get there in time with that honest growth rate? If the answer is no, then continuous improvement won\u0026rsquo;t help you.  Again, this isn\u0026rsquo;t magic. Instead, it would be best to look at high-risk / high-reward tactics. They aren\u0026rsquo;t the first choice. Since they have a high chance of failure, you\u0026rsquo;d pick a less risky alternative (like continuous improvement) if it would allow you to win. However, if the less risky approach is guaranteed insufficient, the high-risk option is the only viable one.\nIf you have only 10$ and need to make millions by the end of the day, buying lottery tickets (or other form of gambling) is the only way to have a chance of achieving that goal. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re almost guaranteed to lose, at least you have a chance. If you invest it in stocks (or any other form of investment where the odds of losing all money are low), you have a good chance of ending the day with more money but 0 chances of making millions. 0.000000072 is greater than 0.\nSo, while continuous improvement is excellent, and you should focus on it for many things, remember that it isn\u0026rsquo;t magic. Sometimes, it isn\u0026rsquo;t enough. Look at the current state, the goal, the timeframe you have, the current growth, and any deviation from the required growth. Then, don\u0026rsquo;t guess; do the actual math. We\u0026rsquo;re bad at guessing exponential growth; minor variations have significant impacts, so be careful.\n",

This king, by the name of Han, dwelled in a magnificent palace nestled atop the tallest mountain in the realm. To reach his palace, one had to navigate a treacherous path that wound its way up the steep slopes.\nAccompanying King Han on his journey were his two trusted advisors: the elder sage, Master Li, and the younger scholar, Apprentice Zhou. As they began their ascent, Master Li, with his weathered countenance and years of experience, advised the king to take the longer but safer route, which had been traversed by countless travelers before.\n\u0026ldquo;Your Majesty,\u0026rdquo; Master Li cautioned, \u0026ldquo;though this path may be longer, it is tried and true. It will ensure your safe arrival at the palace, where you may revel in its splendor and luxury.\u0026rdquo;\nHowever, Apprentice Zhou, with his youthful enthusiasm and eagerness to impress the king, had a different suggestion.\n\u0026ldquo;Your Majesty,\u0026rdquo; he proposed, \u0026ldquo;why waste time on the longer path when a quicker route lies before us? If we take this shortcut,\u0026rdquo; pointing towards a narrow trail that led to a massive cliff, \u0026ldquo;we can reach the palace sooner and bask in its riches without delay.\u0026rdquo;\nDespite Master Li\u0026rsquo;s wise counsel, King Han found himself swayed by Apprentice Zhou\u0026rsquo;s persuasive argument. Overlooking his own intuition, the king made the fateful decision to follow the younger advisor\u0026rsquo;s advice and embarked upon the shortcut towards the cliff.\nAs they approached the precipice, it became apparent that the gap was far wider than they had anticipated. With no bridge to cross and no alternative route available, they stood at the edge, facing a perilous leap.\nMaster Li, foreseeing the tragic outcome of their decision, shook his head in dismay. \u0026ldquo;Your Majesty,\u0026rdquo; he implored once more, \u0026ldquo;heed not the allure of haste. Patience and prudence are the pillars of wise governance. Let us retreat and take the path that promises safety and security.\u0026rdquo;\nBut the king, blinded by the promise of swift arrival, and Apprentice Zhou, driven by his desire to please, ignored Master Li\u0026rsquo;s plea. With a misguided sense of confidence, they attempted to leap across the chasm.\nAlas, their folly proved fatal. None among them possessed the strength or agility to clear the gaping void, and they plummeted into the abyss below.\nMaster Li, witnessing the tragic demise of his king and apprentice, felt a profound sense of sorrow and regret. In the aftermath of this calamity, he resolved to depart from the kingdom of Wisdom Peak, seeking solace and a new purpose elsewhere.\nFinding refuge in a distant land, Master Li offered his sage counsel to another ruler, hoping that his hard-learned lessons would guide this monarch towards a wiser and more enlightened reign. And so, amidst the echoes of past mistakes, Master Li embarked on a journey of redemption, carrying with him the memory of King Han and the solemn vow to never again witness such tragedy.\n A few learnings from this tale:\n As a leader, you have to use your own judgment. Be especially careful when you want to believe the claims, since you want the associated outcomes. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to follow others against your best judgment. If they don\u0026rsquo;t want to listen, let them die and move on. Something that is obviously a bad idea from your perspective may not look like that to others.

Sometimes, despite our best efforts, external factors can lead to failure. Embracing the idea that not every failure is a reflection of our skills allows for more constructive self-reflection. We can focus on improving our skills and strategies, even when luck doesn\u0026rsquo;t go our way.\n  Empathy and Collaboration: When assessing the work of our colleagues, understanding that they too face elements of luck can foster better collaboration and support. Instead of dismissing their failures as incompetence, consider the external factors that may have influenced the outcome. This shift in perspective can lead to more effective teamwork.\n  Evaluating Competitors: Just as we often attribute our own failures to bad luck and our successes to skill, we tend to attribute our competitors' successes to luck. By recognizing that competitors also possess skills and face their own share of challenges, we can engage in healthier competition and learn from their successes rather than dismissing them as mere luck.\n  Better Decision-Making: Embracing probabilistic thinking can improve our decision-making processes. In software engineering, where outcomes are often uncertain, acknowledging the role of luck allows us to make more informed choices. We can assess risks and uncertainties, plan for contingencies, and adopt a more adaptive and resilient approach to our projects.\n  Continuous Learning: Recognizing the interplay of skill and luck in software engineering encourages a culture of continuous learning. When successes are attributed to both skills and luck, we are more inclined to understand the areas where improvement is needed. Similarly, acknowledging the impact of luck on failures can prevent a demoralizing blame game and instead promote a focus on learning from mistakes.\n   Annie Duke\u0026rsquo;s concept of probabilistic thinking challenges the conventional wisdom of attributing success solely to skills and failure solely to bad luck. In the dynamic world of software engineering, where outcomes are often uncertain, this perspective is invaluable. By embracing the role of both skill and luck, we can make better decisions, engage in more constructive self-reflection, and foster collaboration and empathy among team members.\nAs software engineering leaders, let\u0026rsquo;s encourage our teams to adopt this probabilistic mindset. It can help us navigate the complexities of our field with a more open and rational perspective, leading to better results, improved teamwork, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Code that is intricate and hard to follow can lead to a constant struggle to fix bugs, add features, or adapt to changing requirements. As your codebase grows in complexity, so does the likelihood of introducing new bugs when making changes.\n  Knowledge Gaps Complexity creates knowledge gaps.

More code paths, intricate algorithms, and excessive abstractions can slow down your application. In many cases, simpler solutions are not only easier to understand but also more efficient in terms of performance.\n  The Beauty of Simplicity\nSimplicity is not the same as laziness or a lack of ambition. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s about finding the most straightforward and efficient solution to a problem. Here are some reasons why simplicity should be celebrated:\n  Easier to Understand Simpler code is easier to understand. When you write code that is clear, concise, and straightforward, not only is it easier for you to grasp, but it\u0026rsquo;s also easier for your colleagues to understand. This promotes better collaboration and makes it easier to onboard new team members.\n  Reduced Bugs Simple solutions tend to have fewer bugs. When you have a clear understanding of the code you\u0026rsquo;re working with, you\u0026rsquo;re less likely to introduce errors when making changes. In complex systems, bugs can hide in the labyrinth of code paths, making them harder to detect and fix.\n  Faster Development Simplicity often leads to faster development. With a simpler codebase, you spend less time deciphering and navigating the complexities, and more time writing and testing new features. This can accelerate your development process and help you respond to changing requirements more efficiently.\n  Better Performance Simple solutions can also result in better performance. Less convoluted code tends to be more efficient, as there are fewer layers of abstraction and indirection. In many cases, a straightforward approach can outperform a convoluted one.\n  When to Choose Complexity Over Simplicity\nOf course, there are situations where complexity is warranted. Certain problems are inherently complex, and simplicity can lead to oversimplification, which isn\u0026rsquo;t a solution either. When dealing with large-scale distributed systems, cryptographic algorithms, or some cutting-edge AI models, complexity is a necessity.\nHowever, even in complex domains, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to strive for simplicity within the complexity. For example, you can isolate the complexity in well-defined modules or components, keeping the rest of your codebase as simple as possible. This makes it easier to reason about and maintain your system.\nAs software engineers, we must learn to strike a balance between complexity and simplicity. Complexity should be a tool in our toolkit, but not the default choice. By embracing simplicity, we can create code that is more maintainable, reliable, and efficient, ultimately leading to better software and happier developers.\nOriginally published on Plato\n",

      "content_text": "The Problem\nWhen you have a remote engineering team, the tools you use are really important since you can’t use an office as a band-aid. We had some issues with our project management tools, where some information didn’t reach the relevant people. We needed to fix that to improve our productivity.\nActions Taken\nMy first action was to reach out to everyone involved and get more feedback on our current software engineering process, what’s working well and what isn’t. Using this information, I’ve clarified and fine-tuned our process and went searching for a new software product that would better fit that improved process.\nOnce we got that new software, we agreed to do a 1-month trial. Shorter than that wouldn’t have been enough to work out the kinks of the new tool. As expected, there were some bumps when we switched to it. Some team members wanted to cut the trial short, but I reminded everyone that our agreement was to try for 1 month, and we need to give this an honest attempt if we want to improve our productivity.\nAfter the trial, I did a retrospective to gather everyone’s feedback. Some were positive, some were negative. It was about a 50/50 split between keeping this new tool vs. going back to our previous suite of tools. Neither options were compelling; we felt stuck.\nThen I reviewed all the feedback - for the original suite of tools and the new tool - and realized that we actually had a third option available that was much better. It was actually possible to implement the new process (that we all preferred) using a subset of our old suite of tools (that most people preferred). So we could get the new, improved process AND use tools that the majority preferred AND reduce the number of tools we had to use. This was a win - win - win scenario.\nLessons Learned\nWhile some people would consider the trial a failure (because we spent 1 month trying a tool that we didn’t keep and had to go back), this was actually a success. The goal of trying new things is to learn and improve. That trial allowed us to discover a new way of working with our existing tools, which resulted in improved productivity.

You’re optimistic about your team; you’ve chosen them well and are looking forward to what you’ll build together. But now the easy part is done (hiring), you have to build that distributed team as a cohesive unit.\nThis is a challenge that all teams have, it isn’t specific to distributed team. But it is a challenge that all distributed team knows they need to tackle. When the team is all collocated, sometimes (but more often than most would admit), there’s a tendency to ignore it and assume it will be resolved on its own, that there’s no need to consciously do something about it.\nThe foundation of a cohesive team is communication. If you have good communication, the team can function as a single unit. If communication is lacking, things fill break apart over time and the team will become dysfunctional. Any situation, every event that happens, good or bad, can be traced back to communication.\nCommunication is a two way street. Messages transmitted need to be interpreted by the other side, and the interpretation part is as important. Ever played team games like Pictionary or Cranium, where one team member need to guess what the other person meant? Some teams are much better at it than others. The same drawing, nobody else would guess, but that team member knows you enough that your intended message is clear and the person gets it.\nSo what you aim for, is having that level of good communication happening in your team. For this to be possible, a few aspects need to be considered :\n Trust Empathy Understanding your mission  Trust\nTrust is the basis of any good communication. When there is no trust, you assume the message you receive is a lie and that you need to reinterpret it to really know the truth. Of course, whether it is a lie or not isn’t relevant because you don’t trust it anyway. While adversarial situation like that happens, this is definitely not something you want in your team. Hiring trustworthy people should be your number one goal when hiring, but sometimes mistakes happen. If you don’t feel that you can trust your teammates, don’t wait and dig right now into that, to understand why.\nThere are ways to build and increase trust in your team and you should look into that. But if you really think the person isn’t trustworthy, then consider that a bad hire, let the person go in the most human way possible, and move on.\nEmpathy\n Empathy is the capacity to understand or feel what another person is experiencing from within their frame of reference, that is, the capacity to place oneself in another’s position. — Wikipedia\n Without empathy, any diverging opinions can quickly devolve into an adversarial situation. Again, this is something you DO NOT WANT to happen in your team. When every body’s aligned, all is good. When it isn’t the case, you need empathy.\nI believe the natural response that most people have when someone brings a different point of view, or says something that contradicts what you are already thinking, is a defensive response. You consider the different opinion to be an attack and you look for possible defenses against that imaginary attack. The tendency of this happening is a bit lower when the interaction is in person, because you get more cues (ie, voice tone, body language, etc.) about the person’s intent, but it definitely happens often too. Feeling attacked over an email or text message is more frequent because you lack those cues, so your brain fill it in and our evolutionary path led us to default on the side of considering everything to be an attack, unless you have evidence to the contrary.\nThat said, it is easy to counteract this natural reaction. Taking a few seconds (or minutes) before replying back is effective and super simple to do in text communication. As such, you should never hurry your replies, take the time to let your initial emotions and reaction pass and reply only when you’re clear headed.\nAn improved version of that is to ask clarifying questions, or rephrasing the other’s point using your own words, to make sure you understand the intent and all the details. This result in your taking more time before actually replying, but it also allows you to improve your understanding of the other person’s message. It is a rare occurrence that you really 100% understand exactly what the other person meant. By asking questions back, it help you clarify the picture and get more insight into the other’s thinking process. All that result in a better understanding, that will likely be that there was no attack intended here at all.\nUnderstanding your mission\nSince the opportunities for random communication will be less (if not completely null) in a distributed environment, risk of everyone understanding the mission or goals of the business or team differently are higher. Difference in understanding can lead to differences in how to solve problems, what to prioritize, what to talk about, etc.\nAs such, making sure everyone really understand your mission and goals should be high on your priority list. This implies that you have a clear mission and goals in the first place, so if that isn’t the case, well, you know what to work on now. But once this is nailed, you should spam it around as much as you can. Keep repeating this over and over and over. If everyone really knows where you’re going, our brains fill in the blanks and rearrange our understandings to make it align in that direction. So every time a message won’t be 100% clear, the odds of the other person to interpret it “the right way” will be much higher.\nThis also reduces the chances of conflict because everyone works toward the same goals (ie. no internal competitions). Another nice side effect is that productivity will go up, again, because everyone will paddle in the same direction.\n There’s of course more to this, but it is mostly on the tactical side. Everything ends up resolving to either trust, empathy, and/or understanding of mission. Ensure those 3 aspects are good and you will have a cohesive (distributed) team.\n",

      "content_text": "There’s a world of difference between a 100% remote business and a business where remote work is the exception. If you work remotely and are in that 2nd group, here are 7 tips to help you succeed in that situation.\nLook for a 100% remote environment, or at least a remote friendly place\nMight seem obvious, but isn’t. You have many reasons to work where you’re working. So think about this, be honest with yourself, and verify if it is really worth it. 100% remote and remote friendly workplaces are way better from a remote work environment point of view (of course). You aren’t an outlier there. You don’t start with 2 strikes against you. You don’t have to worry about hallway conversation you’re missing.\nA workplace that view and value remote work will be aligned with your own situation, understand your needs, and know how to make remote works a stunning success for everyone.\nAgain, you may have other reasons to still want to stay in that remote-unfriendly place (greater learning opportunities, significantly better compensation, really care about the company’s vision, etc.). And that’s all fine if you decide it’s better for you to stay there. But at least have that be a conscious decision. Take the time to think about this and make that call. Don’t be afraid to leave if nothing holds you there.\nDon’t stress out\nA major concern and cause of stress for remote workers is about how others (and specifically their manager) views their performance. There’s a flaw where many people equate physical presence in office with being productive. That’s obviously false. Measuring performance is not as simple (which I’ve discussed in a Remote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All).\nThe first step here is to try to not stress about this. You are likely judging yourself much harder, and minimizing your own performance (because you only see yourself). Keep in mind that remote workers are more performing anyway.\nBut even with that knowledge, you might still stress about this. I know I did. To help with that, I use some simple guidelines :\n Do my best, all the time (ie. no procrastination) I allocate myself a set amount of working hours per week, and stick to that as much as possible (yes, startups needs flexibility). If that isn’t good enough, then I should find another place to work as this isn’t a fit.  Fortunately, that was never needed. Which would prove that I was stressing about this for no good reason. I know I do my best work, and that I “put in” a reasonable amount of time. So if everything else is a match, those guidelines should ensure my performance all good.\nTry to over communicate\nWhen you work remotely, it is impossible to over communicate. Impossible. So your goal is to communicate as much as possible, trying to achieve that impossible goal. It is the only way you can end up communicating just the right amount. You might feel you communicate too much, but trust me, you are likely communicating just enough.\nThis is true even in 100% remote environment, but much more important when you are one of the few working remotely. In that scenario, other people won’t be communicating enough. By overcompensating, you will trigger those moments when others reply with “Oh yes, sorry we forgot to tell you about this change”. If you don’t make it happens, you will be left behind and either let go or you’ll leave on your own.\nSo whatever communication channel you have, whether it is Slack or email or Google Meet, use and abuse them. You want to be heard, you want others to understand where you stand, you want to get feedback if you are on the wrong path. So spam away!\nDon’t use remote as an excuse\nThat one may be obvious, but it is worth mentioning. If everyone in your team is working from the office and you’re the only one working remotely, the worst thing you can do is use that as an excuse. It is never constructive to use excuses anyway. But if you are the only one with that privilege, you really don’t want to bring attention to this. If remote causes you some unique challenges, then you have to figure a way to fix that.\nAsking others for help would be fine in an environment that is supportive of remote work. But if you are the only remote worker in your team, it took you lots of efforts to convince them to allow you to work remotely (or join the team as the first remote employee), they might be waiting to see how this experiment will fail. It is harsh, yes (that’s why you’d be better working somewhere that remote work is welcomed), but that’s the reality.\nInterpret communication in good faith\nRemote work use a lot more of written communication. But it is easier to misunderstand tones and intents in written form. As such, you should interpret everything assuming the other person is in good faith. Don’t take anything personally, don’t assume bad intention or any other negative / aggressive stance from others.\nThat’s basically the Robustness Principle, applied to human-to-human communication.\n Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. — Jon Postel\n Even if that isn’t always easy for everyone all the time, since you aren’t face-to-face with the other person, you can take the time to pause, breath, and make sure you’re calm before replying back. This goes a long way toward allowing you to interpret communication in good faith.\nDon’t use sarcasm or irony; be factual and well intended\nThis is actually the 1st part of the Robustness Principle : “Be conservative in what you do”. Sarcasm and irony, when used in written communication, are hard to distinguish as such. You want the other person to really understand the message you are writing, so have it clear, concise, and well intended. Especially when others aren’t used to remote work, they might not know about “be liberal in what you accept from others”, so the risk of them understanding bad intent in what you wrote is hire.\nThat’s also a good reason to keep hard conversion for video chat as much as possible. When you have video support, it greatly reduces the risk of misunderstanding, as you have the full body language to help you understand the other person’s feelings and reactions, so you can adjust your message as you go along, and clarify what isn’t understood correctly immediately.\nBe proactive and willing to do the extra work\nFinally, keep in mind that if your remote situation works against you AND you want to keep this job, you will have to constantly prove you are worth it. You need to be a top achiever. Being proactive, keeping an eye on which area you can help and provide value will go a long way toward that.\nIf you are the only remote worker, odds are that productivity will be (at least partially) judged by how much time you spend in the office. Which is an obvious problem for you. By being proactive and more productive than others, you can make sure you stay top of mind. That even if you aren’t seen, people will notice you anyway.\nOriginally published on Medium\n",

Measuring performance is not as simple (which I’ve discussed in a \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@laurent.parenteau/remote-work-problems-arent-related-to-remote-at-all-7f916e505272\"\u003eRemote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step here is to try to not stress about this. You are likely judging yourself much harder, and minimizing your own performance (because you only see yourself). Keep in mind that \u003ca href=\"https://www.inc.com/scott-mautz/a-2-year-stanford-study-shows-astonishing-productivity-boost-of-working-from-home.html\"\u003eremote workers are more performing\u003c/a\u003e anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even with that knowledge, you might still stress about this. I know I did. To help with that, I use some simple guidelines :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDo my best, all the time (ie. no procrastination)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI allocate myself a set amount of working hours per week, and stick to that as much as possible (yes, startups needs flexibility).\nIf that isn’t good enough, then I should find another place to work as this isn’t a fit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, that was never needed. Which would prove that I was stressing about this for no good reason. I know I do my best work, and that I “put in” a reasonable amount of time. So if everything else is a match, those guidelines should ensure my performance all good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTry to over communicate\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you work remotely, it is impossible to over communicate. Impossible. So your goal is to communicate as much as possible, trying to achieve that impossible goal. It is the only way you can end up communicating just the right amount. You might feel you communicate too much, but trust me, you are likely communicating just enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is true even in 100% remote environment, but much more important when you are one of the few working remotely. In that scenario, other people won’t be communicating enough. By overcompensating, you will trigger those moments when others reply with “Oh yes, sorry we forgot to tell you about this change”. If you don’t make it happens, you will be left behind and either let go or you’ll leave on your own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo whatever communication channel you have, whether it is Slack or email or Google Meet, use and abuse them. You want to be heard, you want others to understand where you stand, you want to get feedback if you are on the wrong path. So spam away!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t use remote as an excuse\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat one may be obvious, but it is worth mentioning. If everyone in your team is working from the office and you’re the only one working remotely, the worst thing you can do is use that as an excuse. It is never constructive to use excuses anyway. But if you are the only one with that privilege, you really don’t want to bring attention to this. If remote causes you some unique challenges, then you have to figure a way to fix that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAsking others for help would be fine in an environment that is supportive of remote work. But if you are the only remote worker in your team, it took you lots of efforts to convince them to allow you to work remotely (or join the team as the first remote employee), they might be waiting to see how this experiment will fail. It is harsh, yes (that’s why you’d be better working somewhere that remote work is welcomed), but that’s the reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterpret communication in good faith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRemote work use a lot more of written communication. But it is easier to misunderstand tones and intents in written form. As such, you should interpret everything assuming the other person is in good faith. Don’t take anything personally, don’t assume bad intention or any other negative / aggressive stance from others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s basically the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle\"\u003eRobustness Principle\u003c/a\u003e, applied to human-to-human communication.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others. — \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Postel\"\u003eJon Postel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if that isn’t always easy for everyone all the time, since you aren’t face-to-face with the other person, you can take the time to pause, breath, and make sure you’re calm before replying back. This goes a long way toward allowing you to interpret communication in good faith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDon’t use sarcasm or irony; be factual and well intended\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is actually the 1st part of the Robustness Principle : \u003cem\u003e“Be conservative in what you do”\u003c/em\u003e. Sarcasm and irony, when used in written communication, are hard to distinguish as such. You want the other person to really understand the message you are writing, so have it clear, concise, and well intended. Especially when others aren’t used to remote work, they might not know about “be liberal in what you accept from others”, so the risk of them understanding bad intent in what you wrote is hire.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s also a good reason to keep hard conversion for video chat as much as possible. When you have video support, it greatly reduces the risk of misunderstanding, as you have the full body language to help you understand the other person’s feelings and reactions, so you can adjust your message as you go along, and clarify what isn’t understood correctly immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe proactive and willing to do the extra work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, keep in mind that if your remote situation works against you AND you want to keep this job, you will have to constantly prove you are worth it. You need to be a top achiever. Being proactive, keeping an eye on which area you can help and provide value will go a long way toward that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you are the only remote worker, odds are that productivity will be (at least partially) judged by how much time you spend in the office. Which is an obvious problem for you. By being proactive and more productive than others, you can make sure you stay top of mind. That even if you aren’t seen, people will notice you anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginally published on \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@laurent.parenteau/tips-for-remote-workers-in-remote-unfriendly-environments-aa8efe3d9e8d?source=friends_link\u0026amp;sk=efe43b5c9b226133d0827a2221150bbd\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

      "content_text": "For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.\nAs the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected. As such, it is better to start with a minimal setup and adjust as needed. No two teams are the same, so blindly copying the 42 tools setup of some other startup is a bad idea.\nWhat you need initially is simply to fulfill those 3 needs :\n Text communication Video communication Collaborative documents  Text Communication\nThis is how you’ll communicate with your team 99% of the time, since you can’t walk to the other person’s desk. There’s obviously emails, and you might actually be fine with that at the beginning. So if emails works for you stick with this. But managing email chains can become ugly quickly once you’re more than 2–3 people and can’t just always send to everybody. Emails are also not visible to new employee joining, so information sharing of past decision is problematic.\nAs such, some other text communication tools that keep the messages better organized and where new employees get to see all the previous conversation automatically is better.\nThere’s obviously Slack, but many more exist as well, some focusing on remote only environment (which means they’re more aware of the needs you might have). We’ve found that Twist works well for us, but Threads is another popular with for remote teams.\nVideo Communication\nSome people argue about video communication, but I think it is crucial to have this, since it’s the most powerful tool you have initially to get your team to know each other, create empathy, and build your culture. Depending on how much your team is spread across the globe, it might not be easy to have video calls with everyone. That said, even if they aren’t frequent, they tremendously help with team building and getting to know each other.\nWhile it is easy to discuss with others in a video call, keep in mind that this doesn’t leave any documentation about the decision process or the resolution. For that reason, many decisions should be made using text communication instead. The big benefit of video communication is really around team building and highly sensitive topic where being able to rely on visual clues to understand the intents and subtleties of the discussion. So it’s likely a good idea to have culture guidelines around when to use text communication and when to use video communication.\nThere’s a lot of free solutions out there, which do a good job, so you should really start with those. After some time, you might see some issues or aspect you don’t like. Only then, you can start looking for other video communication tools (likely paid) that offer those features you’re after. There’s no good reason to start with a paid tool, even if it has a good reputation, until you need if you need any of the additional features.\nIn our case, we had started with Google Meet and Slack. But as we added more people on the team, we didn’t like that you can’t see everyone simultaneously on the screen. So we went with Whereby as it supports a mosaic view up to 12 people.\nCollaborative Documents\nSame as video communication, one could argue that this isn’t require either, but I don’t see a way around that. You could send documents by email, sure, but we aren’t in the 90s anymore. Online collaborative editing really improve productivity and information sharing.\nYou should get something that cover the basic tools (spreadsheet, document, images) and start with that. There are tons of more specialized solutions, but you should pick them as you find the need for them. Again, don’t use something just because others are using it. You can do everything with normal spreadsheet, document, and drawing tools. So start with that and evolve as needed.\nFor us we picked GSuite, but whatever you prefer. Over time we started to use more specialized tools for some tasks, like Trello and Clubhouse. But it is important to start with just the basic tools. The less invested your are (from a process point of view) in specific tools, the easier it will be to keep evolving your process as you grow. Generic tools are more flexible (by definition) which makes it easy to change your process. Once you invest time into setting up a more specialized tool, it makes it harder to change your process or change tools.\nSummary\nStart with the basic, then evolve with your team as you grow and learn to work together. It is easier to add than remove, so starting with a minimal set of tools, only the one that fills essential needs, you are doing yourself and your team a huge favor.\nOnce you have something for text communication, video communication, and collaborative documents, you should be all set.

      "summary": "No problems are specific to remote work.",
      "content_text": "No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!\nThere are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :\n They confuse symptoms for problems; They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.  Confusing symptoms for problems\nConfusing symptoms for problems happens frequently, in every sphere of activities. If you see something wrong, that’s a symptom. To find the root cause, the underlying issue, the real problem, you need to spend time, investigate, think about it. As a general rule, a single problem can manifest through multiple different symptoms, simultaneously or not. Symptoms for the same problem and also be different, varying based on environment conditions, people involved, culture, etc.\nYou can’t solve a problem by fixing the symptoms. At best, you can mask a problem, reduce the symptoms enough to tolerate the problem. This can work for some time, but since symptoms varies, you should expect to see new symptoms appears over time for the same problem.\nIf you want to solve a problem, you can’t do that by fixing symptoms. You have to work on the problem itself. Once the problem is solved, the resulting symptoms won’t exist anymore either. More importantly, they won’t come back (since the problem is solved for good).\nFor example, “people are showing late for work” is not a problem, it’s a symptom. The problem could be a lack of interest about the work, not knowing what are the expectation around “being in office” hours, not being able to come in early because of traffic or having to drop kids at school, etc. Without digging deeper into the situation, you won’t know what the real problem is. If you think you’re solving the problem by having a mandatory meeting early in the day, well, you’re not. An early meeting won’t increase interest about work, won’t clarify what the expectations are, won’t help with traffic, and won’t have the school open sooner.\nIt is faster/cheaper/easier to act on symptoms. It gives the impression of doing something to fix the problem. It gives the impression of being in control and doing a good job. That’s why we frequently see this happening. Consciously or not, people will fix symptoms instead of working on the underlying problem.\nBlind to the problems\nWhen you are in an office environment, many problems can go unseen. Since you have everybody in the office, the fact that people are physically present blind you of many problems. It can also give you false confidence about many aspects of work culture, which means you don’t even think about those topics, which means you have no way of even considering that there could be a problem in the first place.\nThe easiest example for this is that many will equate presence in office with productivity. So if productivity isn’t enough, the number one solution is to ask people to spend more time in the office (extended hours, no outside lunch, etc.). But slacking in office is an art and many people are good at it. Just because someone is in the office doesn’t mean he’s working anyway. So there was and still is a productivity problem (which is likely caused by something else, as discussed above), but many won’t see it because… people are in office 10 hours a day! There’s just too much work! Not enough resources! But if people were working remotely, the same productivity problem would likely been seen way sooner (before it gets too problematic), as you’d be paying much more attention to this, instead of equating physical presence with productivity.\nBasically, everything you make mandatory has a high chance of rendering you blind to some potential problems. When it isn’t mandatory, you see what doesn’t work right away because nothing is happening. Or people will let you know about the problems because they’ll see them. When something is mandatory, well, people do it. So any problems that would cause people do NOT do it won’t be apparent (but still exist and cause other issues). Since mandating time in office is a big requirement, this has a significant clout and can mask many problems.\nConclusion\nLike everything, there’s always exceptions so yes, there are some challenges that are unique to remote environments, but they are small, not that important. The big stuff you have to care about, the problems that can ripples in the organisation and wreak havoc, those problems aren’t related to the work environment itself. As such, in office or remote, doesn’t make a difference.\nOriginally published on Medium\n",

At best, you can mask a problem, reduce the symptoms enough to tolerate the problem. This can work for some time, but since symptoms varies, you should expect to see new symptoms appears over time for the same problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to solve a problem, you can’t do that by fixing symptoms. You have to work on the problem itself. Once the problem is solved, the resulting symptoms won’t exist anymore either. More importantly, they won’t come back (since the problem is solved for good).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, “people are showing late for work” is not a problem, it’s a symptom. The problem could be a lack of interest about the work, not knowing what are the expectation around “being in office” hours, not being able to come in early because of traffic or having to drop kids at school, etc. Without digging deeper into the situation, you won’t know what the real problem is. If you think you’re solving the problem by having a mandatory meeting early in the day, well, you’re not. An early meeting won’t increase interest about work, won’t clarify what the expectations are, won’t help with traffic, and won’t have the school open sooner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is faster/cheaper/easier to act on symptoms. It gives the impression of doing something to fix the problem. It gives the impression of being in control and doing a good job. That’s why we frequently see this happening. Consciously or not, people will fix symptoms instead of working on the underlying problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlind to the problems\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you are in an office environment, many problems can go unseen. Since you have everybody in the office, the fact that people are physically present blind you of many problems. It can also give you false confidence about many aspects of work culture, which means you don’t even think about those topics, which means you have no way of even considering that there could be a problem in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe easiest example for this is that many will equate presence in office with productivity. So if productivity isn’t enough, the number one solution is to ask people to spend more time in the office (extended hours, no outside lunch, etc.). But slacking in office is an art and many people are good at it. Just because someone is in the office doesn’t mean he’s working anyway. So there was and still is a productivity problem (which is likely caused by something else, as discussed above), but many won’t see it because… people are in office 10 hours a day! There’s just too much work! Not enough resources! But if people were working remotely, the same productivity problem would likely been seen way sooner (before it gets too problematic), as you’d be paying much more attention to this, instead of equating physical presence with productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, everything you make mandatory has a high chance of rendering you blind to some potential problems. When it isn’t mandatory, you see what doesn’t work right away because nothing is happening. Or people will let you know about the problems because they’ll see them. When something is mandatory, well, people do it. So any problems that would cause people do NOT do it won’t be apparent (but still exist and cause other issues). Since mandating time in office is a big requirement, this has a significant clout and can mask many problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConclusion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike everything, there’s always exceptions so yes, there are some challenges that are unique to remote environments, but they are small, not that important. The big stuff you have to care about, the problems that can ripples in the organisation and wreak havoc, those problems aren’t related to the work environment itself. As such, in office or remote, doesn’t make a difference.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginally published on \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@laurent.parenteau/remote-work-problems-arent-related-to-remote-at-all-7f916e505272?source=friends_link\u0026amp;sk=06a28c5ffa18c257e96095c81cf7b611\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",

Therefore you should spend more time figuring out your culture and only start the hiring process itself once you have a clear picture of exactly what you want.

Launching a startup is full of challenges and hiccups, especially in the early days.

      "title": "Leadership Lessons from Parenting",
      "summary": "Become a better leader by interacting with children.",
      "content_text": "Learning comes from all activities, and interacting with children actually teach you many great lessons applicable to leadership. Or is it the other way around? That’s a debate for another day. Whether you have kids or not, those lessons are relevant for anyone in a leadership position or looking for it.\nWhen you say you’ll do something, do it.\nBest way to gain trust, respect and credibility is to do what you’ve told you’ll do. Even if it’s a small thing, or you think it doesn’t matter, or they will likely not care, or they will likely forgot… Do it anyway! Over time, they’ll learn that they can trust what you say.\nIf you don’t, then they will start to ignore what you say since they don’t know if that’s actually true or not. There’s a saying : “actions speak louder than words”. If your words aren’t followed by action, people won’t care about your words anymore. They won’t consider them to show which action will come.\nWith children, you see that quickly. When someone do as he said, kids pick it up fast and then take it into account (they might still not listen, but for other reasons). It’s exactly the same as leader.\nIf you want them to become good at making decisions, let them decide.\nThis one is hard to apply. You want what’s best for your kids, and you have more experience so you want to spare them all the failure you had yourself. But this actually prevent them from learning. So you have to let them decide as much as possible, so they can learn how to make decisions on their own.\nSame thing for your team. How can they learn to make decision if you decide everything for them? Yes, there will be mistakes. Yes, they won’t make the same choice as you. But most of the time, it doesn’t matter. No big problem, no harm done. Most of the time, the difference between yours and theirs isn’t that significant.\nYou don’t let a two years old learn on his own that playing with a gun is dangerous. You have to set boundaries, and let him make the decision that’s capable of. Just as you likely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let a new junior employee full control over the production system without supervision.\nBut whenever possible, whenever the decision is within the capacity of the person, you should favor letting them decide.\nWhat is obvious to you may not be to them, explain your decision and reasoning.\nWhen kids are young, everybody understands that. But as they get older, people assume they reason and understand the same thing as an adult. But even if they speak fluently and read books and can do pretty much everything on their own, they still don’t have the same experience as you, the same baggage. Many things you take for granted or self evident aren’t for them (yet). Explaining your decision, in addition to resolving that misunderstanding issue, also help them form and improve their own thinking. They get to understand why you made that decision, they can even ask questions to increase that understanding.\nThe same thing apply when you lead others. They aren’t in your head. The reason why you made a decision isn’t necessarily clear to others. Worst, they might even think you made that decision for the wrong reason. But by describing the reasons behind your decision, you ensure there’s no misunderstanding. Same as for kids, this can prompt them to ask questions, which is a healthy. You’ll be sure everybody is aligned.\nPeople learn a lot from others, so sharing your decision making process allow others to grow as well. It serves as example, template, or reference point for them. Even in the case where they think your decision is bad, if they know how you reached that decision, they might see a pattern they don’t want to follow themselves!\nIf you don’t listen to them they will stop talking to you.\nMy love has a poster near her desk that says :\n If you don’t listen to the small things when they are small, they won’t tell you the big things when they are big. Because it was big things for them all along.\n You want kids and teammates alike to get into the habit of speaking, of telling things, of sharing their thoughts, their concerns, their ideas, their feelings.\nThere’s a big difference between hearing someone talk, and listening to them. Hearing other is meaningless, waste time, and can make them feel miserable. You have to listen. If you’re thinking about what you’ll say next, that’s not listening. If you’re thinking about something else (you’re busy you know), that’s not listening. If you’re thinking about rebuttals or argument as the other is talking, that’s not listening. If you’re waiting for them to be done just to reply “thank you, but no thanks”, that’s not listening.\nIf you want them excited about a journey, present it to them from their idea of fun.\nEveryone’s priorities are different. Our values, what we like, what we dislike, what feels important and what doesn’t are different too. This means that if you want someone to be excited about your project, about the trip you’re planing, about the journey ahead, you have to point out the details that are exciting for the other peoples.\nThis implies you know what they like, what they’re looking for. This implies you need to talk to them and listen (see point above). You have to pay attention to what motivates them, what makes them happy.\nThey look at how you handle hard situations and follow your steps.\nThere’s a big debate about nature vs nurture, but everybody agrees that kids learn from looking at how other people around behave. This is actually a key characteristic of every social animal. So no surprise, we keep doing that as we get older too. One difference when we’re older is that we might be aware of that fact, so we can be critical and reflect on what other people did before adopting their behavior. Not everyone does that, or does that all the time, but kids just can’t (yet).\nThis is why it is really important that as a leader, you think about how you react to events. How you handle hard situations. How you behave. You’re being evaluated - either consciously or not - by others. If you are trying to build a great them, you have to show a great example. Social behaviors are contagious, so if you behave badly or there’s a good chance your team will behave the same.\nMoral to this story is…\nThere are many other lessons that can be learned from interacting with kids and applied to leadership in general, and vice versa.

      "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eLearning comes from all activities, and interacting with children actually teach you many great lessons applicable to leadership. Or is it the other way around? That’s a debate for another day. Whether you have kids or not, those lessons are relevant for anyone in a leadership position or looking for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen you say you’ll do something, do it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBest way to gain trust, respect and credibility is to do what you’ve told you’ll do. Even if it’s a small thing, or you think it doesn’t matter, or they will likely not care, or they will likely forgot… Do it anyway! Over time, they’ll learn that they can trust what you say.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t, then they will start to ignore what you say since they don’t know if that’s actually true or not. There’s a saying : “actions speak louder than words”. If your words aren’t followed by action, people won’t care about your words anymore. They won’t consider them to show which action will come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith children, you see that quickly. When someone do as he said, kids pick it up fast and then take it into account (they might still not listen, but for other reasons). It’s exactly the same as leader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want them to become good at making decisions, let them decide.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis one is hard to apply. You want what’s best for your kids, and you have more experience so you want to spare them all the failure you had yourself. But this actually prevent them from learning. So you have to let them decide as much as possible, so they can learn how to make decisions on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSame thing for your team. How can they learn to make decision if you decide everything for them? Yes, there will be mistakes. Yes, they won’t make the same choice as you. But most of the time, it doesn’t matter. No big problem, no harm done. Most of the time, the difference between yours and theirs isn’t that significant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t let a two years old learn on his own that playing with a gun is dangerous. You have to set boundaries, and let him make the decision that’s capable of. Just as you likely wouldn\u0026rsquo;t let a new junior employee full control over the production system without supervision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut whenever possible, whenever the decision is within the capacity of the person, you should favor letting them decide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is obvious to you may not be to them, explain your decision and reasoning.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen kids are young, everybody understands that. But as they get older, people assume they reason and understand the same thing as an adult. But even if they speak fluently and read books and can do pretty much everything on their own, they still don’t have the same experience as you, the same baggage. Many things you take for granted or self evident aren’t for them (yet). Explaining your decision, in addition to resolving that misunderstanding issue, also help them form and improve their own thinking. They get to understand why you made that decision, they can even ask questions to increase that understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe same thing apply when you lead others. They aren’t in your head. The reason why you made a decision isn’t necessarily clear to others. Worst, they might even think you made that decision for the wrong reason. But by describing the reasons behind your decision, you ensure there’s no misunderstanding. Same as for kids, this can prompt them to ask questions, which is a healthy. You’ll be sure everybody is aligned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople learn a lot from others, so sharing your decision making process allow others to grow as well. It serves as example, template, or reference point for them. Even in the case where they think your decision is bad, if they know how you reached that decision, they might see a pattern they don’t want to follow themselves!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you don’t listen to them they will stop talking to you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy love has a poster near her desk that says :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t listen to the small things when they are small, they won’t tell you the big things when they are big. Because it was big things for them all along.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou want kids and teammates alike to get into the habit of speaking, of telling things, of sharing their thoughts, their concerns, their ideas, their feelings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a big difference between hearing someone talk, and listening to them. Hearing other is meaningless, waste time, and can make them feel miserable. You have to listen. If you’re thinking about what you’ll say next, that’s not listening. If you’re thinking about something else (you’re busy you know), that’s not listening. If you’re thinking about rebuttals or argument as the other is talking, that’s not listening. If you’re waiting for them to be done just to reply “thank you, but no thanks”, that’s not listening.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you want them excited about a journey, present it to them from their idea of fun.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEveryone’s priorities are different. Our values, what we like, what we dislike, what feels important and what doesn’t are different too. This means that if you want someone to be excited about your project, about the trip you’re planing, about the journey ahead, you have to point out the details that are exciting for the other peoples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis implies you know what they like, what they’re looking for. This implies you need to talk to them and listen (see point above). You have to pay attention to what motivates them, what makes them happy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThey look at how you handle hard situations and follow your steps.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a big debate about nature vs nurture, but everybody agrees that kids learn from looking at how other people around behave. This is actually a key characteristic of every social animal. So no surprise, we keep doing that as we get older too. One difference when we’re older is that we might be aware of that fact, so we can be critical and reflect on what other people did before adopting their behavior. Not everyone does that, or does that all the time, but kids just can’t (yet).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why it is really important that as a leader, you think about how you react to events. How you handle hard situations. How you behave. You’re being evaluated - either consciously or not - by others. If you are trying to build a great them, you have to show a great example. Social behaviors are contagious, so if you behave badly or there’s a good chance your team will behave the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoral to this story is…\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many other lessons that can be learned from interacting with kids and applied to leadership in general, and vice versa.

Arts, fiction, biology, physics, woodworking, etc. By learning from other domains, you look at similar problems or concepts from a different point of view. This lead to more insight into your own craft. And THAT is what will make you a better software engineer. Better than your peers.\nWhile I encourage others to keep this broad and diversified, I have found some books to be particularly relevant to software engineers.\nI’ll explain why I picked those books below, but for the impatiens…\nTL;DR Every software engineer should read those 4 books, but most haven’t :\n The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering, by Fred Brooks How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie The Elements of Style, by William Strunk JR and E. B. White   Software engineering is about building stuff. And other people will use what you build. Design is about interaction, how what you build interact with others. This goes at all levels, from GUI to physical interaction to APIs.\nWhile not all software engineers need to be good at graphic design, it is a critical skill to be good at UI/UX, even if what you create is a low level library, other software engineers will use it.\nUnderstanding design also provides a lot of insight about UI/UX designers do and how they think. Whenever you communicate with someone, the more you understand his world view, the more you can empathize with them. So learning about design improve both your own work, but also your communication ability with a key person in the software world.\n Yes, it’s old. Yes, some parts didn’t aged well. Still, the main findings from Mr. Brooks seems forgotten every now and then. As a software engineer, you don’t NEED to know everything about management. But knowing the basics of it, the “common sense” on this topic (which isn’t as common as what’s implied) is very valuable.\nAnd while the book is well known for “the mythical man-month” discussion, there are a lot of other really insightful findings in there.\n Most software projects are done with others. You might have a hobby project that only you care about, but for most of the stuff you have to interact with others. As such, knowing how to interact with others in an appropriate way is a critical skill to master.\nThat might sound stereotypical, but for most software engineers social skills aren’t their main force. But like every skill, you can learn it, improve it, become good at it.\nThere are many books on this topic, some focusing on specific aspects of professional social interactions (networking, 1:1, delivering feedback, etc.). But I prefer a book that looks at this topic from a wider point of view, for the general public. Then you can apply what you learn, whatever the context is.\n You’ll spend most of your time writing. Either writing code, writing documentation, writing emails, writing code reviews, writing design, writing architecture, etc. Better become good at it.\nAlso, a lot of good advice for writing well apply to other forms of communication as well. Pay attention to what you learn, and see if that’s applicable to other spheres too. That way, you get even more value out of the same book. I got some good management advice from that book, since some concepts are almost universal.\n And that’s it. Again, those are the books that everyone should read and learn from. But the most important thing to remember is :\n Read from other domain than your own. Pay attention to what you learn, and think about how where that could be applicable, where this could be useful as well. Keep expanding into new directions, that’s a great way to bring new ideas into your own specific domain.  That is the key to rising above the crowd.\nOriginally published on Medium\n",

Better than your peers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I encourage others to keep this broad and diversified, I have found some books to be particularly relevant to software engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ll explain why I picked those books below, but for the impatiens…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTL;DR Every software engineer should read those 4 books, but most haven’t :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things\"\u003eThe Design of Everyday Things\u003c/a\u003e, by Don Norman\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month\"\u003eThe Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering\u003c/a\u003e, by Fred Brooks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People\"\u003eHow to Win Friends and Influence People\u003c/a\u003e, by Dale Carnegie\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style\"\u003eThe Elements of Style\u003c/a\u003e, by William Strunk JR and E.

And other people will use what you build. Design is about interaction, how what you build interact with others. This goes at all levels, from GUI to physical interaction to APIs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile not all software engineers need to be good at graphic design, it is a critical skill to be good at UI/UX, even if what you create is a low level library, other software engineers will use it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding design also provides a lot of insight about UI/UX designers do and how they think. Whenever you communicate with someone, the more you understand his world view, the more you can empathize with them. So learning about design improve both your own work, but also your communication ability with a key person in the software world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*ExKDxlq3C2aaR6-mNUmHSQ.jpeg\"\n  alt=\"The Mythical Man-Month cover\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  class=\"full-width\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, it’s old. Yes, some parts didn’t aged well. Still, the main findings from Mr. Brooks seems forgotten every now and then. As a software engineer, you don’t NEED to know everything about management. But knowing the basics of it, the “common sense” on this topic (which isn’t as common as what’s implied) is very valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd while the book is well known for “the mythical man-month” discussion, there are a lot of other really insightful findings in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*S_NolHqYFBN3ULogu77lzw.jpeg\"\n  alt=\"How to Win Friends \u0026amp;amp; Influence People cover\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  class=\"full-width\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost software projects are done with others. You might have a hobby project that only you care about, but for most of the stuff you have to interact with others. As such, knowing how to interact with others in an appropriate way is a critical skill to master.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat might sound stereotypical, but for most software engineers social skills aren’t their main force. But like every skill, you can learn it, improve it, become good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many books on this topic, some focusing on specific aspects of professional social interactions (networking, 1:1, delivering feedback, etc.). But I prefer a book that looks at this topic from a wider point of view, for the general public. Then you can apply what you learn, whatever the context is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg\n  src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j3LRroc_VI6pVobVijkAMw.jpeg\"\n  alt=\"The Elements of Style cover\"\n  loading=\"lazy\"\n  decoding=\"async\"\n  class=\"full-width\"\n/\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll spend most of your time writing. Either writing code, writing documentation, writing emails, writing code reviews, writing design, writing architecture, etc. Better become good at it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso, a lot of good advice for writing well apply to other forms of communication as well. Pay attention to what you learn, and see if that’s applicable to other spheres too. That way, you get even more value out of the same book. I got some good management advice from that book, since some concepts are almost universal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd that’s it. Again, those are the books that everyone should read and learn from. But the most important thing to remember is :\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRead from other domain than your own.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePay attention to what you learn, and think about how where that could be applicable, where this could be useful as well.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eKeep expanding into new directions, that’s a great way to bring new ideas into your own specific domain.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is the key to rising above the crowd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginally published on \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@laurent.parenteau/the-most-valuable-and-underrated-books-for-software-engineers-49ab9b459886\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n",
