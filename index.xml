      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a world of difference between a 100% remote business and a business where remote work is the exception. If you work remotely and are in that 2nd group, here are 7 tips to help you succeed in that situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Minimal Tool Box for Remote Startups</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/post/minimal-tool-box-for-remote-startups/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For most things, whether a startup is remote or not doesn’t make much difference in what you need. The tools you need depends on what you are actually building, not how your business is organized. But there are 3 needs that are crucial for remote startups. They all revolve around communication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the business and the team grows and mature, like all things the tools you used will evolve. Some will be added, some will be abandoned, that’s expected. As such, it is better to start with a minimal setup and adjust as needed. No two teams are the same, so blindly copying the 42 tools setup of some other startup is a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you need initially is simply to fulfill those 3 needs :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Text communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Video communication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Remote Work Problems Aren’t Related to Remote at All</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/post/remote-work-problems-arent-related-to-remote-at-all/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No problems are specific to remote work. Every time someone claims “this is a problem with remote work”, it is wrong. All the problems you have in a remote work environment, you actually have them in an office environment too. ALL of them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main reasons why people think some problems are specific to remote work environment :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They confuse symptoms for problems;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are blind to the fact that the problem is present in the office environment too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <title>Intel gathering from the interview process</title>
      <link>https://laurentparenteau.com/post/intel-gathering-from-the-interview-process/</link>

      <guid>https://laurentparenteau.com/post/intel-gathering-from-the-interview-process/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a job interview is two fold :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Employer figures out if he wants you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You figure out if you want to work with them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people forget about that 2nd point, but it is equally important. Now, to figure out if you want to work with them, you can ask questions. But you can also learn a lot from the interview process itself and how its conducted. You just have to pay attention to what is (not) said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Learning comes from all activities, and interacting with children actually teach you many great lessons applicable to leadership. Or is it the other way around? That’s a debate for another day. Whether you have kids or not, those lessons are relevant for anyone in a leadership position or looking for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything starts for good reasons. When you start a new project, getting a cadence, a sense of progress, a way to see the journey done so far and what lies ahead provide benefits. But has you progress, it is time to revisit this cadence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You want to become a better software engineer. You learn new tech stack, you do hackathon, you’ve read &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Complete&#34;&gt;Code Complete&lt;/a&gt; twice and follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kentbeck&#34;&gt;Kent Beck on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. That’s all good. But focusing only on the technical side is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
